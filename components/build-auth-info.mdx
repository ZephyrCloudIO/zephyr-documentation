:::info
The first time you initiate a build with Zephyr, it will prompt you to log in by directing you to the Zephyr website. This login is required only on your first build; subsequent builds will not require a login.

We may require you to log in again if you removed your Zephyr configuration file `~/.zephyr` locally.
