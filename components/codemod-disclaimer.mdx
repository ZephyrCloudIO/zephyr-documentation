:::tip{title="Quick Setup with Codemod"}
Before manually installing plugins, you can use our codemod to automatically configure Zephyr for your project:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://with.zephyr-cloud.io | node
```

Or use with your preferred package manager:

```bash
npx with-zephyr
# or
pnpm dlx with-zephyr
# or
yarn dlx with-zephyr
```

This will automatically detect your bundler and configure Zephyr for you. For more information about the codemod, see [with-zephyr on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/with-zephyr).

If you prefer manual setup, continue with the guide below.
