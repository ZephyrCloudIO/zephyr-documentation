To start with our example, you can [**fork our example**](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-repack-example) or use our creation command. This is a comprehensive example where, if you are building with Zephyr using React Native, this structure is normally where you would start.

### Structure

Our React Native application is currently powered by [Re.Pack](https://re-pack.dev) built by [Callstack](https://callstack.com) and [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io). Re.Pack handled the CLI overwrite in React Native, cross-platform runtime for Module Federation and utility rule sets for React Native. 

When you are deploying, building your application with Zephyr, Zephyr will [resolve your remote dependencies automatically](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/how-to/mf-guide) (powered by dependency delegate in Zephyr plugins), handle the build and deploy process for you. You can read more about the project's structure in repository's [README.md](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-repack-example/blob/main/README.md).

Within the repository, you can see several folders: 

- `apps`: contains all the remotes, host and e2e tests 
    - `mobile-host`: manage most of the navigation and routing of the whole application and is the provider of authentication. state, and API for remote applications. 
    - `mobile-checkout`: a remote of `mobile-cart`, provide checkout screen. 
    - `mobile-cart`: a remote of `mobile-host`, provide cart screen after users added items to cart and click on cart button. 
    - `mobile-inventory`: a remote of `mobile-host`, provide inventory screen for users to view and select items.  
    - `mobile-orders`: a remote of `mobile-host`, provide orders screen for users to view and manage their orders
- `packages`: contains all the shared packages including 
    - `mobile-sdk`: core app utilities including auth, api, data and UI
    - `mobile-core`: handle dependency management and utilities
    - `mobile-eslint-config`: eslint config for mobile
- `patches`: contains pathces for npm dependenciess to ensure application runs smoothly 






## Creation command

Alternatively, you can also use our creation command to scaffold your project. 

```bash
npx create-zephyr-apps@latest
```

And select the following options: 

```
‚óá  Where should we create your project?
‚îÇ  ./react-native-playground
‚îÇ
‚óá  What type of project you are creating?
‚îÇ  React Native
‚îÇ
‚óá  Project successfully created at react-native-playground
```



Once your have the project locally, you can run below commands in sequence to start the development server. **Note that in all Zephyr's applications, you need to run a build for remotes to help zephyr understand what are the remote applications.** 


## Running the project 

Commands to run the project smoothly for iOS development: 

```bash 
# Installing the dependencies 
pnpm install 

```

Because `mobile-checkout` is the remote of `mobile-cart`, you will need to build `mobile-checkout` first. 

```bash 
ZC=1 pnpm --filter MobileCheckout run start --platform ios
```

`ZC=1` is the environment variable how we set up the project to kick off Zephyr deployment. 

After `mobile-checkout` is built and deployed (make sure the deployed URL kicked back, if not you can report the bug in our [Discord](https://zephyr-cloud.io/discord)), you can run `mobile-cart` (a remote for `mobile-inventory`). 

```bash 
ZC=1 pnpm --filter MobileCart run start --platform ios
```

Subsequently, you can now run `mobile-inventory` and deploy it. 

```bash 
ZC=1 pnpm --filter MobileInventory run start --platform ios
```
After `mobile-inventory` is deployed, you can now run `mobile-orders`(the last remote we have yet deployed) and deploy it. 

```bash 
ZC=1 pnpm --filter MobileOrders run start --platform ios
```

Once all the remotes are deployed, you can now run `mobile-host` to see the whole application. 

First of all you need to bundle the host application and kick off the iOS emulator. 

```bash 
ZC=1 pnpm --filter MobileHost run ios
```

But after that whether you run all the dev server with the command below: 


```bash 
ZC=1 pnpm run start
```

Or you only want to run the host application without any remotes, you can run the command below: 

```bash 
ZC=1 pnpm --filter MobileHost run start --platform ios
```

Everything would work smoothly - vice versa for Android development.
