## Setting Up a React Native Host Application

Starting from our base RSpack setup, we need to make some modifications.

First, we need to stabilize the port number because we don't want it colliding with other running servers or services.

### Stabilizing the port number

That starts with setting the PORT number for the React Native application to talk to the bundler.

To do that we add `RCT_METRO_PORT` to the `ios` script in the `package.json` file.

```json
"ios": "RTC_METRO_PORT=8082 react-native run-ios --no-packager",
```

This will compile the iOS application using the port number 8082. You can change this port number to any other number that is not being used by other services.

Next we need to stabilize the port number for the bundler.

To do that we add the `--port` flag to the `react-native start` command in the `package.json` file.

```json
"start": "react-native start --port 8082",
```

Now the application and the bundler will be fixed to the same port number.

### Running The Application

Now that the application is configured we can build and run it.

```bash
npm run ios
```

This will build the application and run it on the iOS simulator.

Next we need to start the bundler:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the bundler and the application will be able to connect to it.

You will want to keep the bundler running while you are developing so that any changes you make to the code are reflected immediately.

### Configuring The Host For Module Federation

Because we need to share dependencies between the host and the remotes, we need to bring the dependencies of the host application into the RSpack confiugration file.

To do this we add this line:

```ts
import pkg from './package.json' with { type: "json" };
```

To the top of the `rspack.config.mjs` file.

Then we need to add the Module Federation Plugin to the plugins array.

```ts
  new Repack.plugins.ModuleFederationPluginV2({
    name: '[app-name]',
    filename: '[app-name].container.js.bundle',
    remotes: {
    },
    shared: Object.fromEntries(
      Object.entries(pkg.dependencies).map((dep, version) => {
        return [
          dep,
          {singleton: true, eager: true, requiredVersion: version},
        ];
      }),
    ),
  }),
```

You'll need to replace `[app-name]` with the name of the application. You should also replace the `[app-name]` callout on the `filename` key with your application name.

The code for the shared object will iterate through all of the dependencies in the `package.json` file and create a new object that has the version number as `requiredVersion` and `singleton` and `eager` set to `true`.

`singleton` means that the dependency will be loaded only once and shared across the remotes.

`eager` means that the dependency will be loaded when the host is loaded.

`requiredVersion` is the version of the dependency that is required by the host.

### Adding Remotes

Next well need to add the remotes that the host will be using.

Here is an example of how to add a remote:

```ts
remotes: {
  Cart: `Cart@http://localhost:9000/ios/Cart.container.js.bundle`,
},
```

This will add the `Cart` remote to the host. The `Cart` remote is the name of the remote that we will be using in the remote application.

Note that we are specifying `ios` in the path. This is because we are building for iOS. If we were building for Android, we would specify `android` in the path.

### Module Federation Enhanced

The Module Federation Enhanced library is required for the runtime to work properly.

To install it we run:

```bash
npm install @module-federation/enhanced
```

### Using the Federated Module

We can demonstrate the usage of the federated module by importing a new component to the host application.

Here is an example of how to import a new component:

```tsx
const CartList = React.lazy(() => import("Cart/CartList"));
```

Use the `React.lazy` function to import the component from the remote dynamically.

Then we can use the component in the host application:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Text>Loading...</Text>}>
  <CartList />
</Suspense>
```

This will load the `CartList` component from the remote and display it in the host application. You have to wrap the component in a `Suspense` component because the component is loaded dynamically.

You do not have to provide a fallback. If you do not provide a fallback, the component will not be displayed until it is loaded.

### Applications Can Be Both Hosts and Remotes

Applications can be both hosts and remotes. This allows you to create a truly federated architecture.

To do this the application simply needs to also have a `exposes` object in the `ModuleFederationPluginV2` configuration. And then it can expose modules to other host applications.
