# React + Rspack + Nx

:::info Prerequisites

- We expect you to have finish our [Get Started](/general/get-started) guide.
- Have our [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) installed in your browser.
- A registered account on [Zephyr Cloud](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io).
- npm >=10
- node >=20 

If you don't have `nvm` to manage your node version yet, head to [the official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it.
```bash 
nvm use 20 
```

### Setup


#### 1. Create an Nx workspace

Run below commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace --preset=apps
```
And select from these options: 

```bash title="Terminal"
? Which stack do you want to use? None. 
? Package-based monorepo, integrated monorepo, or standalone project? Integrated Monorepo. 
? Which CI provider would you like to use? skip 
? Would you like remote caching to make your build faster? No
```

#### 2. Add hosts and remote

In your terminal, run: 

```bash title="Terminal"
npx nx add @nx/react
npx nx g @nx/react:host --remotes=remote1,remote2 --bundler=rspack --directory=apps/host 
```

In the terminal select from below answers: 

```bash title="Terminal"
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? - css 
? Which E2E test runner would you like to use? - cypress 
? What should be the project name and where should it be generated? 
‚ùØ As provided:
    Name: host
    Root: apps/host
```

Your Nx application's initial setup is complete! If you run: 

```bash title="Terminal"
npx nx run-many -t build --parallel=1 --skip-nx-cache --verbose -p host remote1 remote2
# Or alternatively only serve host 
npx nx run host:serve
```
You can see your application in the browser. 

#### 3. Naming each components

To understand why these configuration are necessary - [Read the complete checklist to deploy Micro-Frontend with Zephyr](/how-to/mf-guide). 

Open the new directory in your selected editor and add `package.json` as a structure below: 

```yaml title="Folder structure" {3,5,7}
- apps 
-- host 
--- package.json 
-- remote1 
--- package.json 
-- remote2 
--- package.json 
```

In host's `package.json`, add below field (minimal example): 

```json 
{
  "name": "host",
  "version": "0.0.0"
}
```

In remote1's `package.json`, add below field: 

```json 
{
  "name": "remote1",
  "version": "0.0.0"
}
```

In remote2's `package.json`, add below field: 

```json 
{
  "name": "remote2",
  "version": "0.0.0"
}
```

#### 4. Create your first commit 

After making sure each application in this project has a `package.json` and the naming align with the unique name in module federation config, you will need to make sure this project is a github repository and has at least one commit hash by running `git commit -m "commit something"` command. 

#### 5. Adding configuration for Zephyr

Install Zephyr's plugin for Rspack (works in Webpack too): 

```sh title="Terminal"
npm i zephyr-webpack-plugin@latest 
```

Add Zephyr plugin to each application's build config by adding below lines from Nx's auto-generated build config: 

```ts title="rspack.config.ts" {6,24}
import { composePlugins, withNx, withReact } from '@nx/rspack';
import {
  withModuleFederation,
  ModuleFederationConfig,
} from '@nx/rspack/module-federation';
import { withZephyr } from "zephyr-webpack-plugin"

import baseConfig from './module-federation.config';

const config: ModuleFederationConfig = {
  ...baseConfig,
};

// Nx plugins for rspack to build config object from Nx options and context.
/**
 * DTS Plugin is disabled in Nx Workspaces as Nx already provides Typing support for Module Federation
 * The DTS Plugin can be enabled by setting dts: true
 * Learn more about the DTS Plugin here: https://module-federation.io/configure/dts.html
 */
export default composePlugins(
  withNx(),
  withReact(),
  withModuleFederation(config, { dts: false }),
  withZephyr() // the plugin sequence in Nx matters. Do remember to put zephyr at the end of your config file. 
)
```
You will need to do the same for `rspack.config.prod.ts` for host app. 

#### 6. Rollback to previous version 

The first option in the dropdown menu under **Version** is the latest deployment of your app. In the dropdown menu you will see more previous version of your app. 

But if you want to rollback to the previous version of your deployed application, you can click on one of the options and that version will show up in the browser, once you confirm that you want to push it to production you can click on **Publish updates** at the bottom of the side panel. 


#### 6. Chrome Extension 

You can check the application you just deployed in our chrome extension. 

Head to Chrome Web Store to install our chrome extension - [Zephyr Mission Control](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn). Click on **Add to Chrome** and confirm with **Add extension**. After you finish remember to **pin** the extension by clicking on <DrawingPinIcon className="inline -rotate-45"/> on extension management tab to provide you a quicker access to Zephyr's side panel.



Once you click on the Chrome Extension, a login page will pop up and prompt you to log in (if you are using Microsoft Edge you will need to click on **Open Side Panel**).



:::details{title="What happens when you log in?"}
While we are loggin you in, we are storing your authorization information locally under `~/.zephyr` in your root directly. Whenever you want to clean up your local profile information (they are JWT claims for each of the project you deployed through Zephyr), you can enter your root directory in terminal and run: 
```bash 
rm rf ~/.zephyr 
```
:::

Now you have created an account and the side panel is empty - hold up! We will get into how to use our dashboard in a bit. Let's deploy an app through Zephyr so you can see a live example of how to use our side panel.

:::info
Our chrome extension is only supported on Chromium based browsers. See a list of [supported browser](/supported#browser-support).

#### 7. Dashboard 

If you want to see all your projects and their versions, sign in on [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) and you will see all your projects and their dependencies.

A more detailed explaination on how to use our dashboard is coming soon.
