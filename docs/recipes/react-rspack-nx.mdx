# React + Rspack + Nx

:::info Prerequisites

- We expect you to have finished our [Get Started](/general/get-started) guide.
- Have our [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) installed in your browser.
- A registered account on [Zephyr Cloud](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io).
- npm >=10
- node >=20 

If you don't have `nvm` to manage your node version yet, head to [the official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it.
```bash 
nvm use 20 
```

### Setup


#### 1. Create an Nx workspace

Run below commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace --preset=apps
```
And select from these options: 

```bash title="Terminal"
? Which stack do you want to use? None. 
? Package-based monorepo, integrated monorepo, or standalone project? Integrated Monorepo. 
? Which CI provider would you like to use? skip 
? Would you like remote caching to make your build faster? No
```

#### 2. Add hosts and remote

In your terminal, run: 

```bash title="Terminal"
npx nx add @nx/react
npx nx g @nx/react:host --remotes=remote1,remote2 --bundler=rspack --directory=apps/host 
```

In the terminal select from below answers: 

```bash title="Terminal"
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? - css 
? Which E2E test runner would you like to use? - cypress 
? What should be the project name and where should it be generated? 
‚ùØ As provided:
    Name: host
    Root: apps/host
```

Your Nx application's initial setup is complete! If you run: 

```bash title="Terminal"
npx nx run host:serve
```
You can see your application in the browser. 

#### 3. Naming each application

To understand why these configuration are necessary - [Read the complete checklist to deploy Micro-Frontend with Zephyr](/how-to/mf-guide). 

Open the new directory in your selected editor and add `package.json` as a structure below: 

```yaml title="Folder structure" {3,5,7}
- apps 
-- host 
--- package.json 
-- remote1 
--- package.json 
-- remote2 
--- package.json 
```

This command will create all 3 files for you

```bash title="Terminal
touch apps/host/package.json apps/remote1/package.json apps/remote2/package.json
```

In host's `package.json`, add below field (minimal example): 

```json 
{
  "name": "host",
  "version": "0.0.0"
}
```

In remote1's `package.json`, add below field: 

```json 
{
  "name": "remote1",
  "version": "0.0.0"
}
```

In remote2's `package.json`, add below field: 

```json 
{
  "name": "remote2",
  "version": "0.0.0"
}
```

#### 4. Create your first commit 

After making sure each application in this project has a `package.json` and the naming aligns with the unique name in module federation config, you will need to make sure this project is a github repository and has at least one commit hash by running `git commit -m "commit something"` command. 

#### 5. Adding configuration for Zephyr

Install Zephyr's plugin for Rspack (works in Webpack too): 

```sh title="Terminal"
npm i zephyr-rspack-plugin@latest 
```

Add Zephyr plugin to each application's build config by adding below lines from Nx's auto-generated build config: 

```ts title="rspack.config.ts" {6,24}
import { composePlugins, withNx, withReact } from '@nx/rspack';
import {
  withModuleFederation,
  ModuleFederationConfig,
} from '@nx/rspack/module-federation';
import { withZephyr } from "zephyr-rspack-plugin"

import baseConfig from './module-federation.config';

const config: ModuleFederationConfig = {
  ...baseConfig,
};

// Nx plugins for rspack to build config object from Nx options and context.
/**
 * DTS Plugin is disabled in Nx Workspaces as Nx already provides Typing support for Module Federation
 * The DTS Plugin can be enabled by setting dts: true
 * Learn more about the DTS Plugin here: https://module-federation.io/configure/dts.html
 */
export default composePlugins(
  withNx(),
  withReact(),
  withModuleFederation(config, { dts: false }),
  withZephyr() // the plugin sequence in Nx matters. Do remember to put zephyr at the end of your config file. 
)
```
You will need to do the same for `rspack.config.prod.ts` for host app.

#### 6. Build the remotes and serve the host

You have to build the remote applications first; this ensures that the host application can properly contact the remotes.

```bash Title=Terminal
nx run remote1:build
```

```bash Title=Terminal
nx run remote2:build
```
Now you can serve the host application to check if everything is working properly, which through nx magic will start the two remotes. 

```bash Title=Terminal
nx run host:serve
```

Your host app should start on port 4200 by default and each remote will spin up on its own port. All three applications should be deployed now.

#### 7. Chrome Extension 

You can check the application you just deployed in our chrome extension. 

Head to Chrome Web Store to install our chrome extension - [Zephyr Mission Control](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn). Click on **Add to Chrome** and confirm with **Add extension**. After you finish remember to **pin** the extension by clicking on <DrawingPinIcon className="inline -rotate-45"/> on extension management tab to provide you a quicker access to Zephyr's side panel.

Once you click on the Chrome Extension, a login page will pop up and prompt you to log in (if you are using Microsoft Edge you will need to click on **Open Side Panel**).



:::details{title="What happens when you log in?"}
While we are logging you in, we are storing your authorization information locally under `~/.zephyr` in your root directly. Whenever you want to clean up your local profile information (they are JWT claims for each of the project you deployed through Zephyr), you can enter your root directory in terminal and run: 
```bash 
rm rf ~/.zephyr 
```
:::

Now that you have logged in and deployed your apps; you should see the versions of the host application, and the versions of our two remotes (remote1 & remote2). Make some changes locally, watch them redeploy and select the new version from the drop down (you may need to refresh the browser to see the latest, if live reload is not checked)

:::info
Our chrome extension is only supported on Chromium based browsers. See a list of [supported browser](/supported#browser-support).
