# React Native, Re.Pack and Module Federations

This guide will explain how to use [Re.Pack](https://re-pack.dev) to build a React Native app that uses [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io) to share code between apps.

:::info Prerequisites

- We expect you to have finished our [Get Started](/general/get-started) guide.
- A registered account on [Zephyr Cloud](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io).
- npm >=10
- **node >=22**
- ruby >= 3.3.2

:::

Several key points that were handled by Re.Pack to make this integration attainable:

1. CLI:
   1. Traditionally when users run `react-native build ios` it will fire metro bundler to build the application
   2. With Re.Pack it will move the build to Rspack
2. Module Federation support
   1. Re.Pack nicely handle the cache invalidation and Federation runtime for cross-platform build
3. Utilities
   1. A couple handy rule sets crafted by Re.Pack
   2. The rule sets are not baked-in/compulsory, user can plug and play with them within rspack config

## Over-the-air updates

Once your federated React Native app is deployed and running in production, you'll want to push updates to your mini-apps without requiring users to download a new version from the app store. This is where Zephyr's over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities come in handy.

The `react-native-zephyr-sdk` package provides a simple way to check for and download updated versions of your mini-apps at runtime. This allows you to deploy bug fixes, feature updates, and new mini-apps instantly to your users.

:::info

This sdk is a runtime dependency and it's best to be paired with `zephyr-repack-plugin` for optimal usage.

:::

### Installation

Install the SDK along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-native-zephyr-sdk@latest
npm install react-native-mmkv@>=3.1.0
```

### Basic Usage

First, initialize the SDK in your host app. We recommend using a shared storage instance name to ensure consistency across your federated modules:

```javascript title="utils/zephyr-sdk.ts"
import { ReactNativeZephyrSDK } from "react-native-zephyr-sdk";
import { ScriptManager } from "@callstack/repack/client";
// Initialize SDK
const storage = new MMKV({
  id: "federation-storage",
});
const sdk = new ReactNativeZephyrSDK({
  storage,
});

// You can also initialise the sdk with Repack
ScriptManager.setStorage(storage);
```

### Checking for Updates

If you are using `zephyr-repack-plugin` to build your app, ensure you follow the [dependency resolution guide](/how-to/dependency-management), and you can check if a newer version of your mini-app is available at runtime:

```javascript title="Component.tsx"
import { registerRemotes, loadRemote } from "@module-federation/runtime";

const remoteName = "YourMiniAppName";
// Check for remote app updates
const result = await sdk.getRemoteApp(remoteName);

const Component = useCallback(() => {
  if (result.isUpdated) {
  // Update available - the SDK will handle downloading
  console.log("Update downloaded successfully");
  // use module federation to load the remote app
  registerRemotes([
    {
      name: remoteName,
      entry: result.availableRemoteUrl,
    },
  ]);
  return loadRemote(remoteName);

} else {
   // if no update is available, we can use the current remote's entry in storage
   const currentRemote = await sdk.getCurrentRemoteUrl("YourMiniAppName");
   registerRemotes([
    {
      name: remoteName,
      entry: currentRemote,
    },
  ]);
  // No update available or error occurred
  console.log("No update available");
  return loadRemote(remoteName);
}
}, []);


```

### Version Resolution

The SDK supports multiple version resolution formats:

- **Semantic versioning**: `"^1.0.0"` - Gets the latest compatible version
- **Workspace matching**: Automatically resolves versions from your workspace
- **Zephyr Registry references**: Direct references to specific registry versions
- **Scoped packages**: Support for `@scope/package-name` naming conventions

You can follow the below example to use the version resolution with the sdk:

```javascript title="Component.tsx"
import { ReactNativeZephyrSDK } from "react-native-zephyr-sdk";

const sdk = new ReactNativeZephyrSDK();
// Semantic versioning
const result = await sdk.getRemoteApp("YourMiniAppName@1.0.0");

// Environment name
const result2 = await sdk.getRemoteApp("YourMiniAppName@environment-name");

// Tag name
const result3 = await sdk.getRemoteApp("YourMiniAppName@tag-name");

// Resolve agnostically to the latest deployed version of the remote
const result4 = await sdk.getRemoteApp("YourMiniAppName@workspace:*");
```

### Integration with Re.Pack

The SDK works seamlessly with Re.Pack's module federation setup. When a new version is downloaded, Re.Pack's runtime will automatically use the updated mini-app on the next load. This means you can update your mini-apps without restarting the main application.

You can read more about repack's implementation in [Repack's documentation](https://re-pack.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start).

### Best Practices

1. **Check for updates on app start**: Initialize update checks when your app launches to ensure users get the latest versions
2. **Handle update failures gracefully**: Always have fallback logic in case updates fail to download
3. **Use shared storage**: Configure the same storage instance name across all your federated modules for consistency
4. **Version your shared dependencies**: Make sure your shared dependencies are compatible across different mini-app versions

## Resolving platforms

Behind `zephyr-repack-plugin`, we auto-handle the platform resolution. When you are building a React Native app, the plugin would recognise the platform and finding, resolving the correct dependencies for the platform. For example if you are building for iOS, the plugin would resolve the iOS dependencies and vice versa for Android. No additional configuration is required to resolve the platform.

For each version that's built and deployed, you can find the platform on the Tag page of the application version, displayed as `IOS` or `ANDROID` next to `Target` field. The platform's name is also part of the tag name that's being created on each deployment.

## Manage dependencies

Sharing dependencies in a federated mobile application differs slightly from a federated web application. It requires more effort due to the native aspects of React Native dependencies.

To make module federation work correctly in React Native applications, we need to configure the `shared` field in the Module Federation plugin from Re.Pack. The general rule is that `react` and `react-native` dependencies must be included in the list and marked as singletons. Marking them as singletons ensures that only one instance of such modules is ever initialized, which is a strict requirement for React and React Native.

If the dependencies are specified in the host app (or a mini application running in isolation), they should also include the `eager` flag. The `eager` flag ensures that the module is initialized at the start of the app.

The same rule applies to all dependencies that include native code. For example, if any mini-app uses a library with native code (such as `react-native-reanimated` or `react-native-mmkv`), it should be added as a singleton and eager-shared dependency in the host app, and as a singleton dependency in the mini-app that uses it.

For shared JavaScript-only dependencies, it's not necessary to mark them as shared, as Re.Pack can handle downloading them from the mini-app. However, for better network efficiency, it is recommended to include them as shared dependencies.

All this effort requires significant maintenance of the dependencies list in `rspack`/`webpack` and `package.json` for each application. This process can be simplified by using Microsoft’s `rnx-align-deps` library with a custom preset and helper functions to generate the shared dependencies list.

## Handle Navigation

Handling navigation in a React Native federated application differs slightly from web apps, as it does not rely solely on a links-based routing system and the browser's history API. Instead, it incorporates native navigation concepts such as UINavigationController on iOS and Fragment on Android.

This has a few implications:

- Every navigator needs to be wrapped in a NavigationContainer.
- It is not possible to navigate directly from one NavigationContainer to another.

Considering best practices for mini application development, one recommended approach is to use multiple NavigationContainer instances: one for the host application and one for each mini application. This allows each mini application to maintain independent navigation states and linking setups (e.g., with unique prefixes). Navigation between mini applications would then rely solely on methods exposed by the host. This approach minimizes the coupling of mini applications by enabling communication between them exclusively through the host application.

However, sometimes we opted for a centralized solution, letting the host manage the navigation using a single NavigationContainer with the navigation structure defined within it. This approach made sense in our case, as some of our mini applications contained only a single isolated screen. It offered several advantages, including:

- A unified source of navigation truth.
- Simplified linking setup.
- Compatibility with all navigation scenarios.
- Adherence to best navigation practices, such as avoiding nested stack navigators and maintaining type safety.

On the downside, this approach increased coupling, which resulted in challenges for standalone development and required host app updates for any navigation changes within the application.

There is also a third solution: using a single NavigationContainer in the host application while exposing navigators from the mini applications. This approach reduces coupling, allowing mini applications to maintain control over their navigators. However, it can lead to undesirable navigation structures, such as deeply nested stack navigators, and a complex linking setup that requires synchronization between the host and mini applications.
