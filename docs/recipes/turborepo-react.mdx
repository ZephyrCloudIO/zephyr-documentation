# React + Rspack + Turborepo

:::info Prerequisites

- We expect you to have finish our [Get Started](/general/get-started) guide.
- Have our [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) installed in your browser.
- A registered account on [Zephyr Cloud](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io).
- npm >=10
- node >=20 

If you don't have `nvm` to manage your node version yet, head to [the official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it.
```bash 
nvm use 20 
```

:::

To get started with Zephyr and Turborepo, zephyr provides a fully functioning starter template. Simply run the following command:

```bash Title="Terminal"
npx create-turbo@latest --example https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples/tree/main/examples/turbo-rspack-mf
```

This will generate a monorepo with 3 applications, 1 host app and 2 remote apps. The project has routing built in.

:::info Git
Zephyr requires git, the next step should be adding git in whatever way you normally do

```bash title=Terminal
git init
```
```bash title=Terminal
git add .
```
```bash title=Terminal
git commit -m "initial commit"
```
:::

Then run:

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm build
```

Turborepo allows us to create task dependencies so the remote applications will build before the host application. Once all the builds are finished, you should see a URL in your terminal to your deployed host app. 

:::warning Build Hanging?
We have noticed the the host application will sometimes hang on the initial build. Please kill the process and restart it.
