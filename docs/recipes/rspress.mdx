# Rspress

:::info Prerequisites

- Finished our [Get Started](/general/get-started) guide.
- Registered an account on [Zephyr Cloud](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io).
- Installed npm >=8.
- Installed node >=18.

If you don't have `nvm` to manage your node versions yet, head to [the official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it.

```bash
nvm use 18
```

## Generating a Rspress project

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm create rspress@latest my-rspress-site
```

and then run commands to make sure you have necessary dependencies installed.

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd my-rspress-site
npm install
```

## Add Zephyr configuration

You should see the website running on localhost. Open `rspress.config.ts` in your editor and add the following modifications:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
import path from 'node:path';
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';
import { withZephyr } from 'zephyr-rspress-plugin'; // Add this line

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  ssg: true,
  builderPlugins: [],
  plugins: [withZephyr()], // Add this line
});
```

:::warning

**Remember to initialize a git repository in current folder**, before you `npm run build` to deploy your app.

:::

With git config initialized, configured, and linked to remote origin, you are ready to deploy:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm run build
```

You should see something similar to the following build output below. The highlighted lines include your deployed URL:

```bash {16-18}
$ rspress-ssg@1.0.0 build
$ rspress build

The total size for the web thread reflects the original files. When the SSG flag is enabled, the uploaded total size corresponds to the already-processed SSG files. If the SSG flag is disabled, the Rspress plugin relies on the Rspack plugin execution, and the total size represents the original, unprocessed files.
