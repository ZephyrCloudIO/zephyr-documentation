## Previewing Versions

Within our browser extension, you can preview all versions of your applications.

When you select an application under **Name**, you will see your latest deployed application in the browser. You can also preview previously deployed version by clicking on the dropdown menu under **Version**. Use [instant rollbacks](/features/instant-rollbacks) to quickly revert to previous versions when needed.

## Micro-Frontends & Remotes

In Zephyr Mission Control, you have the ability to manage your micro-frontends and their respective remote versions. Each registered remote applications are listed under **Remotes**. You can preview the specific versions that are currently deployed or previously deployed.

### Switching Applications

On the main **Application** page under the **Name** field, you can choose under the dropdown list for a selected application - after selection the application will be displayed in your browser.

### Switching Remotes

You can switch between different versions of your remotes to preview under the **Version** field.

Additionally, when you are previewing a host application which consumes other remotes, you can also switch the remote's version under the list of **Remotes** to inspect how different versions of remotes intercepts with host application.

## Tags

Tags are either auto-generated by us, or set up in Zephyr's dashboard by you. When you are deploying an application through Zephyr (for the first time), We will generate a tag fits your current condition.

You can configure specific **Tag rules** in your application's **Settings** page under **Tags** on Zephyr dashboard by creating, or editing a tag. Tags that are attached to an application is shown under **Tags** field on browser extension.
