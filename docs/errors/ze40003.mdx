<ErrorInfo code="ZE40003" terminal />

This error occurs when Zephyr cannot resolve an application with the specified name and version combination.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Verify the application exists

Ensure the application you're trying to reference has been deployed to Zephyr.

### Check the version format

Verify that the version string matches the expected format and corresponds to an existing deployment.

### Check your package.json

Ensure the `name` and `version` fields in your `package.json` are correctly set:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

</Steps>
