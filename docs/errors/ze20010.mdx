This error occurs when a problem between Zephyr's plugin and our servers happens during file upload and a asset for the remote module is not uploaded.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Retry your deployment

If you encounter this error, you can try to deploy your application again. This error can be transient and may not occur on subsequent deployments.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Check your network connection

Ensure that your network connection is stable and that there are no issues with your internet connection. A poor network connection can cause issues with file uploads.
