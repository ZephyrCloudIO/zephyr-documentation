This error occurs when a problem between Zephyr's plugin and our servers happens during file upload and a asset for the remote module is not uploaded.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Retry your deployment

If you encounter this error, you can try to deploy your application again. This error can be transient and may not occur on subsequent deployments.

npm run build

### Check your network connection

Ensure that your network connection is stable and that there are no issues with your internet connection. A poor network connection can cause issues with file uploads.
