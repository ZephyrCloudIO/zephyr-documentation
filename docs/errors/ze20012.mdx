<ErrorInfo code="ZE20012" terminal />

This error happens when the Zephyr's plugin tries to get a list of assets ids from the server to determine which assets it needs to upload, but failed to provide a valid `application_uid` in the request.

<Steps>

### Retry your deployment

If you encounter this error, you can try to deploy your application again. This error can be transient and may not occur on subsequent deployments.

npm run build

### Ensure you are running latest Zephyr plugin

Please update your Zephyr plugin to the latest version to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes.

# Choose the plugin you are using

npm install zephyr-webpack-plugin --latest
npm install rollup-plugin-zephyr --latest
npm install vite-plugin-zephyr --latest

### Clear assets cache

If the error persists, you can try to clear the assets cache and re-run the deployment.

rm -rf ~/.zephyr

</Steps>
