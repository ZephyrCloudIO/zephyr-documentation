<ErrorInfo code="ZE20012" terminal />

This error happens when a Zephyr's plugin tries to get a list of assets ids from the server to determine which assets it needs to upload, but failed to provide a valid `application_uid` in the request.

<Steps>

### Retry your deployment

If you encounter this error, you can try to deploy your application again. This error can be transient and may not occur on subsequent deployments.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Ensure you are running latest Zephyr plugin

Please update your Zephyr plugin to the latest version to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes.

```bash
# Choose the plugin you are using
npm install zephyr-webpack-plugin --latest
npm install rollup-plugin-zephyr --latest
npm install vite-plugin-zephyr --latest
```

### Clear assets cache

If the error persists, you can try to clear the assets cache and re-run the deployment.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
```

</Steps>
