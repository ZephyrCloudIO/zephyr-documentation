<ErrorInfo code="ZE20034" browser />

This error occurs during deployment when there's a TLS/SSL certificate validation issue, specifically with the certificate's alternative names not matching the expected hostname.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Retry the deployment

This can sometimes be a transient network issue. Try deploying again:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Check your network configuration

If you're behind a corporate proxy or VPN, ensure it's not interfering with TLS connections.

### Verify DNS settings

Ensure your DNS is properly configured and resolving to the correct servers.

</Steps>
