When you are running a build through Zephyr, we will verify your `package.json`'s fields to check whether you have the **name** and **version** fields. Later one we use those values to compose `application_uid`. Behind the scene we will be using your `applicaiton_uid` to deploy your application with related information as well as generating build id.

## Debugging the error

Make sure the **name** and **version** fields have a value in your `package.json`!
