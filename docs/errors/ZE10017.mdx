After generating your `application_uid` based on your git config and `package.json`, we save them to your local disk in a folder named `~/.zephyr` and we utilize the information there to help you deploy your applications. Each one of your application has their own unique `application_uid`.

Whenever your are using our plugins - be it [zephyr-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zephyr-webpack-plugin), [vite-plugin-zephyr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-zephyr) or [rollup-plugin-zephyr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-zephyr), the first thing we do when you try to run a build is to check whether there is local configurations exists for thie project to run a build. Your project's unique `application_uid` is how we connect with edge URL and finishing your deployment process.

If the local configuration doesn't exists, we then won't be able to generate a `build id` unique to each of your build. Note that in some scenario you might still be able to run a build - but your deployed url might show you <ErrorLink code="ZE20012" />.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Ensure you have a valid `package.json` file in your project directory.

By valid, we mean it fits json format, include name and version

Also ensure if it sits in where your bundler configuration is.

Related error and potential resolution:

- <ErrorLink code="ZE10010" />
- <ErrorLink code="ZE10011" />
- <ErrorLink code="ZE10012" />

### Make sure you have git remote origin url, git username, email configured.

Related error and potential resolution:

- <ErrorLink code="ZE10014" />
- <ErrorLink code="ZE10015" />
- <ErrorLink code="ZE10016" />

### Clear cache and login again

Remove your local configuration files `~/.zephyr` and login from either [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) or [sidepanel on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) again.

```
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
```
