This error occurs during deployment when Zephyr cannot verify your user identity. This typically indicates an authentication or authorization issue.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Re-authenticate

Clear your local credentials and log in again from the [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) or [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn):

```bash
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
```

### Verify your account

Ensure your account is in good standing and has not been suspended or restricted.

### Check permissions

Verify you have the necessary permissions to deploy to the target project.
