This method is implemented across all bundlers' plugins (see our [supported bundlers and their relevant packages](/supported)).

When we start the deployment process after your build, we first look for a `package.json` file in current directory (the same level) where bundler's configuration file lives based on your bundler's configuration and if not - we will find your current working directory ourselves. How we find your `package.json` file could be determined by two factors:

<Steps>

### Clear cache

Data we cached on your local machine for this specific project in `~/.zephyr` folder, if you have built from this directory.

### Ensure you have a valid `package.json` file in your project directory.

If the above method failed to locate your `package.json` path, we will then recursively look for a `package.json` file in the parent directory of the current one, and keep going one level up until we find a match.

</Steps>

## Debugging the error

Ensure that there is one `package.json` file within either the directory where bundler's configuration lives, or it's parent one.
