<ErrorInfo code="ZE10034" terminal />

This error occurs when Zephyr fails to establish a WebSocket connection to the server. This can happen due to network issues, firewall restrictions, or server unavailability.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Check your network connection

Ensure your network connection is stable and allows WebSocket connections.

### Check firewall settings

If you're behind a corporate firewall or proxy, ensure WebSocket connections are allowed. You may need to contact your network administrator.

### Retry the operation

WebSocket connection issues can be transient. Try running the build again:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Check server status

Visit the [Zephyr status page](https://status.zephyr-cloud.io) to check if there are any ongoing service issues.
