### What does this error mean?

This error means that the application is not able to correctly connect to your Cloud provider.

## Debugging

### 1. Cloudflare Integration

#### a. KV Namespaces

Check if the following namespaces are created on your Cloudflare account:

- `ze_snapshots`
- `ze_files`
- `ze_env`

#### b. Workers

Check if the following workers are created on your Cloudflare account:

- `ze-worker-for-static-upload`

#### c. Worker Routes

Check if the following worker routes are created on your Cloudflare account:

- `ze.<domain.com>/*`
- `*-ze.<domain.com>/*`

#### d. DNS Records

Check if a CNAME record is created on your Cloudflare account/domain - it needs to be a wildcard record (e.g. `*`) and point to `ze.<your-domain>.com`.

##### Example

| Type  | Name |       Content        | Proxy Status | TTL  |
| :---: | :--: | :------------------: | :----------: | :--: |
| CNAME | `*`  | `ze.zephyrcloud.app` |   Proxied    | Auto |

### 2. Fastly Integration

Coming soon.
