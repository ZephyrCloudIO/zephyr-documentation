<ErrorInfo code="ZE20037" browser />

This error occurs when the total size of your deployment assets exceeds the maximum allowed payload size.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Analyze your bundle size

Use your bundler's built-in analysis tools to identify large assets:

```bash
# For webpack
npx webpack --analyze

# For vite
npx vite build --mode analyze
```

### Optimize your assets

- Compress images and use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Enable code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use tree shaking to eliminate dead code

### Check for accidentally included files

Ensure large files like videos, datasets, or source maps aren't being included in the build output.

</Steps>
