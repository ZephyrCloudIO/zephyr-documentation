<ErrorInfo code="ZE40035" terminal />

This error occurs when an HTTP request fails during configuration-related operations. This can be due to network issues, server errors, or connectivity problems.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Check your network connection

Ensure your internet connection is stable and you can reach external services.

### Retry the operation

HTTP errors can be transient. Try running the build again:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Check firewall and proxy settings

If you're behind a corporate firewall or proxy, ensure it's not blocking requests to Zephyr's servers.

### Check server status

Visit the [Zephyr status page](https://status.zephyr-cloud.io) to check for any ongoing service issues.
