If you have successfully deployed one application, you will see your deployed url is a composition of your github's organization name, repository name as well as your `package.json`'s name (yep, we might we done some data sanitization for it). This information is also how we store your information locally (There is a `~/.zephyr` in your root dir) to enable lightning fast deployment. We extract your organization's name and repository name

If project's git remote origin url is not configured, we won't be able to extract your git organization and repository's information to compose deployment information.

## Debugging the error

Make sure the project folder is a git repository:

git init && git add . && git commit -M "init" && git branch -M main

Copy the remote origin's url and run

git add remote origin &lt;remote-url&gt;
