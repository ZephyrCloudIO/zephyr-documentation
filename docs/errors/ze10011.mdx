<ErrorInfo code="ZE10011" terminal />

After we recursively loop for the current working directory where the bundler's config lives and locate the `package.json` file, we then perform a parsing function to make sure your `package.json` is a valid [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format.

If the `package.json` we located is not in a valid JSON format (hey your npm script or dependencies installation will fail if it is not), we will throw the <ErrorLink code="ZE10011" /> error.

## Debugging the error

Although it's unlikely, do make sure your `package.json`'s format is in correct JSON format.
