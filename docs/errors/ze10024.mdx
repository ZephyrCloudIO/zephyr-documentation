<ErrorInfo code="ZE10024" terminal />

This error occurs when the application ID provided to Zephyr is invalid or doesn't match the expected format.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Verify the app ID format

Application IDs should follow the expected format. Check your configuration to ensure the app ID is correctly specified.

### Check your package.json

Ensure your `package.json` has a valid `name` field, as this is often used to derive the application ID.

### Clear local cache

Try clearing the Zephyr cache and rebuilding:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
npm run build
```

</Steps>
