This error occurs when your authentication credentials are valid but you don't have permission to access the requested resource or perform the requested action.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Verify your account permissions

Ensure your account has the necessary permissions for the project or organization you're trying to access.

### Check organization membership

If working with an organization project, confirm you're a member of that organization with appropriate access rights.

### Re-authenticate

Try clearing your local Zephyr credentials and logging in again from the [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) or [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn):

```bash
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
```
