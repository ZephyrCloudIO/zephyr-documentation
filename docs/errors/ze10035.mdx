<ErrorInfo code="ZE10035" terminal />

This error occurs when Zephyr fails to retrieve the application configuration from the server. This can be due to network issues, authentication problems, or server errors.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Verify authentication

Ensure you're properly logged in:

```bash
npx zephyr login
```

### Check your network connection

Ensure your network connection is stable and you can reach Zephyr's servers.

### Clear cache and retry

Try clearing the local cache and rebuilding:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
npx zephyr login
npm run build
```

</Steps>
