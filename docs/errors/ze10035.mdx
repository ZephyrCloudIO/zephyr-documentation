<ErrorInfo code="ZE10035" terminal />

This error occurs when Zephyr fails to retrieve the application configuration from the server. This can be due to network issues, authentication problems, or server errors.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Verify authentication

Ensure you're properly logged in by authenticating from the [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) or [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn).

### Check your network connection

Ensure your network connection is stable and you can reach Zephyr's servers.

### Clear cache and retry

Try clearing the local cache and rebuilding:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
npm run build
```

Then log in again from the dashboard or Chrome extension when prompted.

</Steps>
