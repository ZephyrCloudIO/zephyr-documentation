# Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you get the most out of Zephyr Cloud.

## Micro-Frontends

Micro-Frontends is an architectural pattern that extends the concept of microservices to frontend development. It allows you to:

- **Split large applications** into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Enable independent development** by different teams
- **Use different frameworks** within the same application
- **Deploy components independently** without affecting the whole app

Zephyr Cloud is purpose-built for Micro-Frontend applications, making complex deployment scenarios simple.

## Module Federation

[Module Federation](https://module-federation.io) is the underlying technology that enables Micro-Frontends. It allows JavaScript applications to:

- **Share code dynamically** at runtime
- **Load remote modules** from other applications
- **Expose components** for other applications to consume

Zephyr handles the complexity of Module Federation configuration and dependency resolution automatically.

## Key Terminology

### Host Application

The main application that consumes remote modules from other applications. Also known as a "shell" application.

### Remote Application

An application that exposes modules for consumption by host applications. These are the micro-frontends.

### Federated Modules

Specific components, functions, or pages that are exposed by remote applications and consumed by hosts.

### Application Versions

Every deployment to Zephyr creates a new version of your application. You can:

- **Preview any version** using our Chrome extension or dashboard
- **Rollback instantly** to previous versions
- **Promote versions** to production with one click

### Dependencies

Zephyr automatically resolves and manages:

- **Shared dependencies** between federated applications
- **Version compatibility** across your micro-frontends
- **Dynamic loading** of remote modules

### Environments

Organize your deployments using environments like:

- **Development** - for active development and testing
- **Staging** - for pre-production validation
- **Production** - for live applications

## Edge Deployment

Zephyr deploys your applications to the edge, providing:

- **Sub-second deployment** times
- **Global distribution** for low latency
- **Automatic caching** and optimization
- **Seamless rollbacks** and version management

## Version Control vs Git

While Git manages your source code versions, Zephyr provides **runtime version control**:

- **Git** tracks code changes and development history
- **Zephyr** tracks deployed application states and enables instant rollbacks
- **Both work together** - Zephyr versions map to your Git commits

This separation allows you to test in production safely and rollback instantly without waiting for CI/CD pipelines.

## Next Steps
