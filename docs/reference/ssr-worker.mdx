# SSR Worker (beta)

Zephyr’s **SSR Worker** is our runtime for serving **server-rendered** JavaScript applications at the edge. It runs your server entrypoint inside an isolate and serves the correct server/client assets for a deployed snapshot.

## Availability (important)

:::warning Beta + Cloudflare-only

- **Beta**: this feature is in active development and the API/behavior may change
- **Cloudflare-only**: currently available **only** on Cloudflare
- **Default integration only**: available **only** on Zephyr’s default (managed) Cloudflare integration
- **Not on BYOC**: not available on Bring Your Own Cloud deployments (including custom/non-default integrations)

## How it relates to TanStack Start

When you deploy a TanStack Start project using the Zephyr TanStack Start plugin, Zephyr uploads an **SSR snapshot** (server + client bundles) and configures the SSR Worker to execute the server entrypoint.

See: **[TanStack Start](/meta-frameworks/tanstack-start)**.
