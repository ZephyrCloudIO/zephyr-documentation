# ZE10013

This error occurs when the `name` and/or `version` keys in `package.json` are missing or invalid.

Solution:
1.  Verify that both the `name` and `version` keys are set in `package.json`.
2.  Verify that the `version` key is a [valid version](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).
