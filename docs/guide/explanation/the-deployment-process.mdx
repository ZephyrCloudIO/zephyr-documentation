# The deployment process
Deployment begins via one of Zephyr Cloud's bundler plugins.
When added to your bundler's plugin list, the plugin deploys your bundled application to a remote Zephyr Cloud instance.

## Deployment lifecycle
The deployment lifecycle can be split into three stages:

*   [Initial bundling](#initial-bundling)
*   [Fact gathering](#fact-gathering)
*   [Snapshot upload and tagging](#snapshot-upload-and-tagging)

### Initial bundling
The application is bundled according to your bundler's configuration.
The Zephyr Cloud bundler plugin runs as the last step in the bundling process, initiating the next stage of the process.

### Environment assessment
The bundler plugin first attempts to assess the application and gather facts.
Deployments are identified by metadata relating to the application, including:

*   Details extracted to the Git repository's `origin` remote URL:
    *   The username/organization
    *   The repository name
*   The current Git branch
*   [Whether the application has Module Federation enabled](#module-federation-and-micro-frontends)

Once the details have been gathered, the plugin establishes a connection to the remote Zephyr Cloud instance.
If not already authenticated, the plugin opens a browser window to authenticate.
Otherwise, the plugin uses previously stored credentials located in `~/.zephyr` to authenticate.

### Snapshot upload and tagging
The snapshot created by the bundler is sent to Zephyr Cloud's API alongside the facts gathered in the previous stage.
Zephyr Cloud's API stores the snapshot, updates cached assets, tags the deployment, and returns URLs where the deployment can be accessed.

## Module Federation and micro frontends
As part of the [fact gathering process](#fact-gathering), Zephyr Cloud detects if the application is a micro frontend before deploying it.

When Module Federation is detected, Zephyr Cloud maps the relationships between providers and consumers in your application.
Each component is deployed appropriately.

## Tagging format
Deployments are tagged using a combination of metadata obtained in the [fact gathering process](#fact-gathering).
The tag format depends on whether a deployment is being made locally or via a CI/CD pipeline.

When a local build triggers a deployment, Zephyr Cloud generates a tag based on the current branch and username.

When a CI/CD pipeline triggers a deployment, Zephyr Cloud uses the following logic to determine the tag:

*   If the branch is `main` or `master`, the deployment is tagged `latest`.
*   If the branch is `development`, the deployment is tagged `next`.
*   For all other branches, the tag is identical to the branch name.
