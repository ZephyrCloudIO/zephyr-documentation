# Zephyr Cloud overview
Zephyr Cloud is a cloud-based deployment platform for JavaScript/TypeScript frontend applications.
Unlike traditional deployment platforms, Zephyr Cloud integrates directly with your application's bundler.
This architecture allows for fast deployment of applications from your CI/CD or local machine.

## Fast and flexible deployment
Zephyr Cloud deploys a snapshot of your application as the last stage of the bundling process.
You can deploy to Zephyr Cloud as part of your application's CI/CD pipeline or from your local machineâ€”depending on the size of your application, Zephyr Cloud can deploy a new version in less than one second.

Deployments can be managed via the [Zephyr Cloud Dashboard][dashboard] or the [Zephyr Mission Control][howto-zc-browser] browser extension.

## Enterprise-grade management tools
Zephyr Cloud provides a dashboard to manage applications and deployments across your organization.
Teams allow fine-grained control over access to individual applications and configuration.

## Framework neutral
Applications written in any frontend framework can be deployed to Zephyr Cloud.
Deployment happens at the bundler-level, integrating as an additional plugin in your bundler's configuration.

## Module Federation compatibile
Zephyr Cloud supports Module Federation out of the box when using [Rspack][howto-rspack] or [Webpack][howto-webpack].
You can deploy complex micro frontend projects and monorepos to Zephyr Cloud without special configuration.

## Easy bundler integration
Zephyr Cloud has first-class support for applications bundled using [Rspack][howto-rspack], [Webpack][howto-webpack], and [Vite][howto-vite].
Monorepo projects managed with Nx can be deployed with a bundler supported by Zephyr Cloud.
