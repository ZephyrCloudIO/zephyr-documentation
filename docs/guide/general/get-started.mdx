## Start from scratch

In this section we will walk you through what you will need to start using Zephyr and enjoy its benefits by deploying an application through Zephyr and modifying configuration. We will start with installing and creating your account, then create a standalone React app. At the end of this guide, you will have your first [React](https://react.dev/) app deployed to Zephyr with [Rspack](https://rspress.dev/) as bundler and use our [version control](/guide/usage/versioning) feature to preview all versions that's deployed.

If you are curious to read more about us, you can dive into our [architecture](/guide/architecture), [recipes](/guide/recipes) (for more frameworks and bundlers) and [features](/guide/usage). Below guide is written based on Google Chrome thus other browser's behavior might differ (see a list of [supported browsers](/guide/supported#supported-browsers))

### Setup


#### 1. Create a react app

:::tip{title="Prerequisites"}
- npm >=10
- node >=20 
- A registered account on [Zephyr Cloud](https://zephyr-cloud.io)

If you don't have `nvm` to manage your node version yet, head to [the official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it.
```sh 
nvm use 20 
```
:::


Once the prerequisites are fulfilled, we can start scaffolding our application in the terminal:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rspack@latest" />

The creation process will ask you for **project folder name** and **project template**, we will be choosing `react-ts` in this example: 
```sh 
.../Library/pnpm/store/v3/tmp/dlx-74427  |  +20 ++
.../Library/pnpm/store/v3/tmp/dlx-74427  | Progress: resolved 20, reused 20, downloaded 0, added 20, done
✔ Project folder … rspack-project
? Project template › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯    react
    react-ts
    vue
    vue-ts
```
Press <Keyboard shortcuts={["Enter"]}/>, next we run:

```sh  
cd rspack-project

pnpm install

pnpm run dev
```

Follow the console output to open the app in browser running on localhost.

#### 2. Adding Zephyr
Open the project folder we created with code editor of your choice. Within current working directory, install Zephyr's plugin by running: 

<PackageManagerTabs command="i zephyr-webpack-plugin" />


After install the plugin, open the file `rspack.config.ts` in project root and replace the original configuration as below:

```ts title="rspack.config.mjs" 

import { dirname } from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import { rspack } from "@rspack/core";
import RefreshPlugin from "@rspack/plugin-react-refresh";
import { withZephyr } from "zephyr-webpack-plugin";

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";

export default withZephyr()({
	context: __dirname,
	entry: {
		main: "./src/main.jsx"
	},
	resolve: {
		extensions: ["...", ".ts", ".tsx", ".jsx"]
	},
	module: {
		rules: [
			{
				test: /\.svg$/,
				type: "asset"
			},
			{
				test: /\.(jsx?|tsx?)$/,
				use: [
					{
						loader: "builtin:swc-loader",
						options: {
							jsc: {
								parser: {
									syntax: "typescript",
									tsx: true
								},
								transform: {
									react: {
										runtime: "automatic",
										development: isDev,
										refresh: isDev
									}
								}
							},
							env: {
								targets: [
									"chrome >= 87",
									"edge >= 88",
									"firefox >= 78",
									"safari >= 14"
								]
							}
						}
					}
				]
			}
		]
	},
	plugins: [
		new rspack.DefinePlugin({
			"process.env.NODE_ENV": JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV)
		}),
		new rspack.ProgressPlugin({}),
		new rspack.HtmlRspackPlugin({
			template: "./index.html"
		}),
		isDev ? new RefreshPlugin() : null
	].filter(Boolean),
	experiments: {
		css: true
	}
});


```

#### 3. Git configuration 

The next step is configure the git configuration for your project. 

:::details  Why do you need this step
Behind the scene, we map your git configuration to Zephyr (remote origin url, organization or username, repository name and branch) to deploy your application. Without this step your deployment will fail. 
:::


- **1. Create a new repository on Github**

[Click here](https://github.com/new?name=rspack-project) to create a new repository named **rspack-project** on Github. Choosing either **Private** or **Public** won't affect our deployment. And then click on **Create repository**. 

- **2. Configure remote origin url**

On the next page where your repository has been created on Github, copy paste the command lines under **...or create a new repository on the command line** and execute them in terminal within the project. 

<Separator/>

#### 4. First build and deploy 


After we finished configuring the project, within your terminal run: 

<PackageManagerTabs command="run build" />

If you haven't register an account with us, or you haven't sign in for a while, your default browser will pop up and prompt you to sign up to our dashboard. If you already have an account or signed in recently, the browser will notify that you already signed in. 

Within the terminal you should see your deployed URL. Press <Keyboard shortcuts={["Command"]}/> and click on the URL at the same time to open your deployed URL in your default browser. 

:::info
Note that this URL will live as long you don't delete your account and you can share it with anyone to preview it. We will discuss how and where you can find your deployed URL within our platform next.
:::

<Separator/>

### Chrome Extension 

You can check the application you just deployed in our chrome extension and you can preview **every version of the application** you deploy.

Head to Chrome Web Store to install our chrome extension - [Zephyr Mission Control](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn). Click on **Add to Chrome** and confirm with **Add extension**. After you finish remember to **pin** the extension by clicking on <DrawingPinIcon className="inline -rotate-45"/> on extension management tab to provide you a quicker access to Zephyr's side panel.



Once you click on <img src="/logo.png" className="inline h-5 w-5 brightness-[3]"/> the side panel will pop up and prompt you to log in. You might need to right click on the extension and choose **Open Side Panel** if you are using it for the first time.



:::details{title="What happens when you log in?"}
While we are loggin you in, we are storing your authorization information locally under `~/.zephyr` in your root directly. Whenever you want to clean up your local profile information (they are JWT claims for each of the project you deployed through Zephyr), you can enter your root directory in terminal and run: 
```sh 
rm rf ~/.zephyr 
```
:::


**Open your side panel** by clicking on <img src="/logo.png" className="inline h-5 w-5 brightness-[3]"/>. Note that this URL is alive as long you don't delete your account and you can share it with anyone to preview it. 


Every application you have deployed on Zephyr (under the same account) will be displayed under **Name**, categorized by repository name and their package name. Click on the dropdown menu under **Version** you will see the versions of your app. Items under **Tags** denotate the tag rules of this application, both auto generated by us or set up by you.

<Separator/>

#### 5. Deploy a new version

Now you have deployed the first version, let's add modify the app and deploy a new version. Open the file `src/App.jsx` to change the content of your website:

```jsx title="src/App.jsx"

import React from "react";
import { useState } from "react";
import reactLogo from "./assets/react.svg";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div className="App">
			<div>
				<a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
					<img src={reactLogo} className="logo react" alt="React logo" />
				</a>
			</div>
			<h1>Rspack + React + Zephyr</h1>
			<div className="card">
				<button onClick={() => setCount(count => count + 1)}>
					count is {count}
				</button>
				<p>
					Edit <code>src/App.jsx</code> and save to test HMR
				</p>
			</div>
			<p className="read-the-docs">
				Click on the Rspack and React logos to learn more
			</p>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;

```
Next in your terminal run: 

<PackageManagerTabs command="run build" />


The console output will return the latest deployed URL. On Chrome ChromeExtension, the latest deployed version will be under **Version** dropdown in as the first option. You should see the app's heading is changed to `Rspack + React + Zephyr`


Now the latest version of your app is deployed. You can check the source code till this stage here: <SourceCode href="https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples/tree/rspack-react/examples/rspack-project" />

:::details{title="Version name"}
The names of your versions are generated by Zephyr. The first part of the name is the branch name, serialised version of your email, followed by the version number.
:::


#### 6. Using Chrome Extension 

Once you have deployed a new version of your application, the latest deployed version will show up in browser as soon as you select it under `Name`. 

:::info
Our chrome extension is only supported on Chromium based browsers. See a list of [supported browser](/guide/supported#browser-support).
:::


#### 7. Dashboard 

If you want to see all your projects and their versions, sign in on [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) and you will see all your projects and their dependencies.


More detailed explaination on how to use our dashboard is coming soon.
