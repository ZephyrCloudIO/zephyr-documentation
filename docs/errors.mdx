:::warning Known issue on Managed Cloud VS. Cloud Provider 

Because of Cloudflare Caching, the time to propagate deployed assets (for deployment to be visible) might take from within one minute to an hour and the timing is non-deterministic. 

This is a known issue we are still investigating and seeking for improvements. 

Issue might be happening to: 

- Our managed cloud (**Cloudflare**)
- Customer's custom deployment provider if customers are using Cloudflare. 

If you are following the get started guide without custom deployment provider you will be using our managed cloud. 

Read more about [how to configure Cloudflare](/cloud/cloudflare) and [how to configure Netlify](/cloud/netlify) as your default cloud provider.
