# Updating Deployment Integrations

Keep your deployment integrations up-to-date to ensure access to the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates.

## How to Update Your Integration

<Steps>

### Navigate to Organization Settings

Log in to the [Zephyr Dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) and navigate to your organization-level settings.

### Access Deployment Integrations

In your organization settings, locate the **Deployment Integrations** section where all your configured cloud provider integrations are listed.

### Edit Integration

Click the **Edit** button on the integration you wish to update. This will open the integration configuration screen.

### Check for Updates

At the bottom of the integration configuration screen, you'll see the current worker version information. If an update is available, you'll be presented with an **Update Worker Version** button.

### Apply Update

Click the **Update Worker Version** button to apply the latest version. The update process typically takes a few minutes and will not affect your currently deployed applications.

</Steps>

## Update Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Check for integration updates monthly or when new Zephyr features are announced
- **Team Communication**: Notify your development team when updates are applied, even though their workflow won't change
- **Monitor Deployments**: Keep an eye on your first few deployments after an update to ensure everything works as expected

## Rollback Information

:::warning Important Rollback Note

If you need to perform a rollback of your deployment integration, you must do so through your specific cloud provider's interface, not through the Zephyr dashboard. 

Each cloud provider has different rollback procedures. Consult your cloud provider's documentation for specific rollback instructions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after updating an integration:

1. **Check Integration Status**: Verify the integration shows as "Active" in your dashboard
2. **Review Recent Deployments**: Look for any error messages in your deployment logs
3. **Test with Simple Deploy**: Try deploying a simple application to isolate the issue
4. **Get Help**: If problems persist, reach out to us on [Discord](https://zephyr-cloud.io/discord) with your integration details
