# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Zephyr Cloud and how to get the most out of the platform.

:::details{title="How does Zephyr speed up development?"}

Zephyr integrates with [bundlers](/bundlers/webpack) like Webpack, Rspack, and Vite as a side-effect of your build process to handle deployment automatically. Instead of configuring complex deployment pipelines, Zephyr deploys your application to the edge network as part of your standard build.

**Key benefits:**

- Instant deployments (sub-second)
- No separate deployment configuration needed
- Automatic version management
- [Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)](/cloud) support for custom infrastructure

Learn more in our [Quick Start guide](/getting-started/quick-start) or [Architecture documentation](/reference/architecture).

:::

:::details{title="Do I need Micro-Frontend applications to use Zephyr?"}

No! Zephyr works with any application architecture:

- **Standalone applications** - Deploy single applications without micro-frontends
- **Micro-frontend applications** - Full Module Federation support
- **Hybrid architectures** - Mix of standalone and federated modules

You can see an example of deploying a standalone application with [React, Rspack and Nx](/integrations/react-rspack-nx).

:::

:::details{title="Do the Zephyr plugins affect my build performance?"}

No. Zephyr plugins only act during two specific phases:

1. **Before build starts** - Authentication and initialization
2. **After build completes** - Asset analysis and deployment

The actual build process runs normally without any interference. While Zephyr does enhance Module Federation configurations and handle environment variables for remote resolution, these modifications happen transparently and don't impact build performance.

See more about how we manage the deployment process in our [Architecture guide](/reference/architecture).

:::

:::details{title="Can I use my own cloud provider?"}

Yes! Zephyr supports **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)** deployments. Currently supported providers:

- [Cloudflare](/cloud/cloudflare)
- [Netlify](/cloud/netlify)
- [AWS](/cloud/aws)
- [Fastly](/cloud/fastly)
- [Akamai](/cloud/akamai)

We're continuously adding more providers. See our [Cloud Providers guide](/cloud) for setup instructions.

If you don't see your cloud provider or have specific requirements, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/zephyrcloud) to let us know!

:::details{title="How do I connect custom cloud providers with Zephyr?"}

Start with the [Managing Cloud Providers](/cloud) guide to choose and configure your provider. Each provider has specific setup instructions:

1. Select your cloud provider from the dashboard
2. Follow the provider-specific integration steps
3. Configure your API keys and permissions
4. Deploy your first application

:::details{title="How does Zephyr help with Micro-Frontends?"}

Micro-Frontends can be challenging to deploy and configure properly. Zephyr simplifies this by:

- **Automatic [remote module resolution](/features/remote-dependencies)** - No hardcoded URLs needed
- **Dynamic dependency management** - Resolves correct versions at runtime
- **Version coordination** - Ensures host and remote compatibility
- **Simplified deployment** - Deploy remotes independently without breaking hosts

Zephyr analyzes your Module Federation configuration, resolves your remote applications dynamically, and ensures everything works correctly in the browser.

See our [complete Micro-Frontends guide](/tutorials/mf-guide) for best practices and deployment checklists.

:::

:::details{title="What happens when I log in after running build commands?"}

When you authenticate with Zephyr, we store your authorization information locally in the `~/.zephyr` directory in your home folder. This contains JWT claims for each project you've deployed through Zephyr.

**To clear your local profile:**

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
rm -rf ~/.zephyr
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.zephyr"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
rmdir /s /q %USERPROFILE%\.zephyr
```

This removes all cached authentication tokens. You'll need to log in again the next time you build.

:::details{title="What's the difference between Module Federation 1.0 and 2.0?"}

**Module Federation 1.0:**

- Built into Webpack core
- Focused on Micro-Frontend implementation in Webpack
- Basic runtime module sharing

**Module Federation 2.0:**

- Separated from Webpack repository
- Framework-agnostic (works with Webpack, Rspack, Vite, etc.)
- Enhanced capabilities:
  - Dynamic import types
  - Federation Runtime
  - Runtime Plugin System
  - Better TypeScript support
  - Improved developer experience

Module Federation 2.0 provides extensive capabilities that support large-scale enterprise applications. Learn more in the [Official Module Federation Guide](https://module-federation.io/guide/start/index.html) or our [Module Federation tutorial](/tutorials/mf-guide).
