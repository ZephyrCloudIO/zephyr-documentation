# Prerequisites

Set up your development environment for Zephyr Cloud development.

## Get Started with Zephyr Mission Control

**🚀 Install our browser extension first for the best development experience:**

- **Chrome**: [Install Zephyr Mission Control](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn)

The Zephyr Mission Control extension provides:

- **Real-time deployment monitoring** - See your builds deploy instantly
- **Environment management** - Switch between dev, staging, and production
- **Debug tools** - Inspect module federation and remote modules
- **One-click rollbacks** - Instantly revert problematic deployments
- **Team collaboration** - Share deployment status with your team

## Required Software

Before you can start using Zephyr, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

### Node.js

Zephyr requires **Node.js version 18 or higher**. We recommend using Node.js 24+ for the best experience.

**Quick Check:**

```bash
node --version
# Should output v18.0.0 or higher
```

If you don't have Node.js installed refer below to [Node Version Manager](#node-version-management)

### Package Manager

You'll need a package manager to install Zephyr plugins and dependencies. We recommend them in this order:

1. **pnpm** (most recommended)
2. **bun** (fast alternative)
3. **yarn** (stable option)
4. **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Git

Git is required for version control and some Zephyr workflows:

```bash
git --version
# Should output git version 2.x.x or higher
```

Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) if needed.

## Node Version Management

### Why Use a Version Manager?

Different projects may require different Node.js versions. Version managers allow you to:

- Switch between Node.js versions instantly
- Maintain project-specific Node versions
- Avoid version conflicts between projects

### Node Version Manager (nvm)

**For macOS/Linux:**

1. **Install nvm from [nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):**

2. **Restart your terminal** or reload your profile

3. **Install and use Node.js 24:**

   ```bash
   nvm install 24
   nvm use 24
   nvm alias default 24  # Set as default
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should show v24.x.x
   nvm current     # Should show v24.x.x
   ```

**For Windows:**

Use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows):

1. Download the installer from GitHub releases
2. Install and restart your terminal
3. Use similar commands:
   ```bash
   nvm install 24
   nvm use 24
   ```

### fnm (Fast Node Manager)

A faster alternative to nvm:

**Install fnm:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash

# Windows (with Chocolatey)
choco install fnm
```

**Use fnm:**

```bash
fnm install 24
fnm use 24
fnm default 24
```

### Project-Specific Node Versions

Create a `.nvmrc` file in your project root:

```bash
echo "24" > .nvmrc
```

Then use:

```bash
nvm use    # Uses version specified in .nvmrc
# or
fnm use    # With fnm
```

## Package Manager Setup

### Installing pnpm (Most Recommended)

pnpm is faster, more efficient, and uses less disk space than npm:

```bash
# Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm@latest

# Verify installation
pnpm --version
```

**Why pnpm?**

- Faster installations and less disk usage
- Strict dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies
- Built-in monorepo support
- Compatible with npm ecosystem

### Installing bun (Fast Alternative)

bun is an extremely fast JavaScript runtime and package manager:

```bash
# Install bun (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install bun (Windows)
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

# Verify installation
bun --version
```

**Why bun?**

- Extremely fast package installation
- Built-in bundler and test runner
- Drop-in replacement for npm/yarn
- Native TypeScript support

## Next Steps

Once your environment is set up:

1. **Create a Zephyr Account** → [Sign up at app.zephyr-cloud.io](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io)
2. **Build Your First App** → [Your First App](/tutorials/first-app)
3. **Explore Integration Guides** → [Integration Guides](/integrations/existing-app)
