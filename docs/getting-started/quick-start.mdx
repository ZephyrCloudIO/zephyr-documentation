# Quick Start

Get up and running with Zephyr Cloud in minutes with your preferred bundler.

## Already have an app? Try our codemod!

**üöÄ One-line integration** - Add Zephyr to your existing application instantly:

```bash
# Direct download and run
curl -fsSL https://with.zephyr-cloud.io | node
```

**Or using your preferred package manager:**

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npx with-zephyr',
    yarn: 'yarn dlx with-zephyr',
    pnpm: 'pnpx with-zephyr',
    bun: 'bunx with-zephyr',
  }}
/>

Our intelligent codemod automatically detects your bundler (Webpack, Vite, Rspack, etc.) and configures Zephyr with zero manual setup. Perfect for adding Zephyr to existing projects without disrupting your workflow.

## Micro-frontends and Module Federation

Zephyr makes it easy to build and deploy micro-frontend architectures using **Module Federation**. Share components, libraries, and entire applications across teams while maintaining independent deployments.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Independent Development** - Teams can work autonomously on different parts of your application
- **Runtime Sharing** - Share dependencies and components dynamically without bundling duplicates
- **Incremental Migration** - Gradually modernize legacy applications piece by piece
- **Scalable Architecture** - Build applications that grow with your organization
