# Why Zephyr Cloud

Zephyr Cloud enhances and accelerates the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and we are purpose-built for Micro-Frontends. 


## Purpose-built for Micro-Frontend

We developed Zephyr Cloud in response to recurring questions from our customers about the complexity and difficulties while deploying federated applications. Zephyr represents our second attempt at addressing these challenges, following our initial platform, [Medusa](https://medusa.codes/).

Micro-Frontend is complicated; even the best DevOps in the industry could quote Micro-Frontend as insanity; the majority of deployment platforms don't have out of the box support for Micro-Frontend and require a lot of custom support. 

To deploy a Micro-Frontend application with Zephyr, you only need to run a build (or have it run in the CI). The answer to "how to configure and deploy Micro-Frontend" lives in your code - it's Terraform but in the shape of pre-existing bundler configuration. Zephyr will figure out your output bundle for applications in the browser to fetch remote applications, and helping remotes, hosts applications to communicate correctly. 



## Versions and Rollback 

With large scale enterprises, frontend applications are often written in different frameworks, split across different teams. When a Micro-Frontend applicaiton is deployed (say a remote application getting updated into a host app), sometimes it doesn't fit requirements, or it breaks other parts of the application. 

Our customers have urgent needs to rollback immediately in such situations. Waiting for CI to run and redploy costs time and business value. Unless customers have serveral containers running the same application for versioning - or have a Kubernetes Cluster to recover from it - it's almost impossible to rollback and have versions for an application. 

However, each application deployed throught Zephyr, whether it is a standalone application, remote components, or host applications in Micro-Frontends, is **versioned**. You can rollback immediately from dashboard, from our our Chrome Extension. 


## Public Beta

Zephyr Cloud is currently in public beta stage. As you evaluate Zephyr Cloud please do not hesitate to reach out to us on [Discord](https://zephyr-cloud.io/discord) and provide your feedback.


## How Zephyr Enhances Your Operations

You can use Zephyr to:
* Deploy more rapidly, more frequently
* Manage version control for your frontend
* Rollback or rollforward after component testing and evaluation
* Increase visibility into the connectivity of your micro-frontends
* Manage Micro-Frontend consuming application (remote) versions in `package.json` with `zephyrDependencies` option.
