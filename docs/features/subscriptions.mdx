# Subscriptions

Zephyr Cloud offers flexible subscription plans that scale with your team and usage. Whether you're a solo developer starting out or running a large enterprise deployment, there's a plan designed for your needs.

## Understanding Zephyr Subscriptions

Subscriptions in Zephyr work at the organization level, meaning everyone in your organization shares the same plan and its benefits. This makes it simple to manage billing and ensures your entire team has consistent access to features.

Your subscription includes two main components: seats for team members and deployment allowances for your applications. As your team grows or your usage increases, you can easily upgrade to get more of what you need.

## Subscription Plans

Zephyr offers four subscription tiers, each designed for different team sizes and usage patterns:

### Personal (Free)

Perfect for individual developers and small projects:

- **$0 per month**
- 1 seat included
- 1,000 free deployments per month
- Additional deployments at $0.50 each

The Personal plan is great for getting started, learning Zephyr, or working on personal projects. You get generous deployment limits and access to all the features you need to build and deploy micro-frontend applications.

## How Billing Works

### Usage-Based Components

Zephyr billing combines seat-based and usage-based pricing:

**Seats**: Fixed monthly cost per team member who needs access to your organization. This covers all the core features and collaboration tools.

**Deployments**: Each time you build and deploy an application, it counts as one deployment. Your plan includes a generous allowance, and you only pay for usage beyond that limit.

### Billing Cycles

You can choose monthly or annual billing:

- **Monthly billing**: Charged every month, with flexibility to change plans anytime
- **Annual billing**: Pay for a full year upfront and save 15% on seat costs

Annual billing is perfect if you want to save money and have predictable team sizes. Monthly billing gives you maximum flexibility to adjust as your needs change.

### Overage and Usage Tracking

If you exceed your plan's deployment allowance, you'll be charged for the additional usage at your plan's overage rate. Zephyr tracks your usage in real-time, so you always know where you stand.

You can monitor your usage through the dashboard, which shows:

- Current deployment count for the month
- Remaining deployments in your allowance
- Historical usage trends
- Projected costs for the current billing cycle

## Managing Your Subscription

### Upgrading and Downgrading

Changing your subscription is straightforward:

**Upgrades**: Take effect immediately, giving you access to new limits and features right away. You'll be charged a prorated amount for the current billing period.

**Downgrades**: Are scheduled for your next billing cycle to avoid losing access to features you've already paid for. You can cancel a scheduled downgrade if you change your mind.

### Payment Methods

Zephyr accepts major credit cards through secure Stripe processing. You can:

- Add multiple payment methods
- Set a default payment method
- Update billing information anytime
- View payment history and download invoices

If a payment fails, you get a 7-day grace period to update your payment method before any service interruption.

### Team Size Changes

Adding or removing team members is simple:

**Adding members**: Immediately increases your seat count and monthly bill. New members get full access to your organization's projects and features.

**Removing members**: Reduces your seat count at the next billing cycle. Removed members lose access immediately for security.

## Usage Optimization

### Efficient Deployment Practices

To make the most of your deployment allowance:

**Environment strategy**: Set up development and staging environments to test changes before production deployments.

**Build optimization**: Configure your build process to only deploy when necessary, not on every commit.

### Monitoring and Alerts

- Set up usage alerts in the dashboard
