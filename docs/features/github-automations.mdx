# Building on CI
Zephyr requires an authenticated user in order to publish updates. In order to configure your CI pipeline, and in our case, GitHub actions to build and deploy with Zephyr we will need to add a token
to the secrets for the action.

## Adding the GitHub secret
You will need to create a token on your [API token](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io/profile/settings/user-tokens) page. After creating this token you will need to add it as a secret.
This secret must be assigned to the `ZE_SECRET_TOKEN` environment variable.

```yml title=pull_request.yml
env:
  ZE_SECRET_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ZEPHYR_AUTH_TOKEN }}
```

## Plugin behavior when secret token presents
When the Zephyr plugin is triggered on an environment that holds the `ZE_SECRET_TOKEN` environment variable, it will use this token to authenticate with the Zephyr API and bypassing the usual log in step. 

You will notice that with a log in the console, the plugin will print the following message:

```shell
 ZEPHYR   Token found in environment. Using secret token for authentication
```
