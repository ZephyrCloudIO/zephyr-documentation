**Zephyr Cloud** is a platform to accelerate your development workflow by providing a simple way to deploy and manage your applications - cloud agnostic, framework agnostic and bundler agnostic.

Under the hood, Zephyr takes a snapshot of your application and deploy it to the edge in sub-seconds, allowing you to preview and test your application in a real-world environment before deploying it to production - make "testing in production" a reality. Whenever the version of your application is ready for production, you can promote it to production with a single click.

Whether you're are a small team or a large enterprise, Zephyr Cloud is designed to remove the ambiguity between different cloud providers, helping you build with speed and freedom.

If you experience any issues, do jump in our [Discord](https://zephyr-cloud.io/discord) and let us know (we hang out here!).
