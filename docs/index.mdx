**Zephyr Cloud** is a Module Federation platform that accelerates micro-frontend development by providing instant deployment, intelligent dependency resolution, and seamless version management—all while remaining cloud agnostic, framework agnostic, and bundler agnostic.

## How It Works

Zephyr captures every build as an immutable version and deploys it to the global edge network in seconds. Each version receives its own preview URL, allowing you to test in a real-world environment before promoting to production. When you're ready, deploy to production with a single click—and roll back just as quickly if needed.

Behind the scenes, Zephyr automatically resolves dependencies between your micro-frontends, eliminates duplicate assets through content-addressed storage, and handles Module Federation configuration across multiple bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Rspack, Rollup, and more).

## Built for Speed and Freedom

Whether you're a small team shipping features fast or a large enterprise coordinating multiple micro-frontends across teams, Zephyr Cloud removes the complexity of cloud provider configuration and deployment orchestration—letting you focus on building great applications.

Deploy to Cloudflare, AWS, Netlify, Fastly, or Vercel without changing a single line of code. Switch providers anytime without vendor lock-in.
