**Zephyr Cloud** is a platform to accelerate your development workflow by providing a simple way to deploy and manage your applications - cloud agnostic, framework agnostic and bundler agnostic<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>.

Under the hood, Zephyr takes a snapshot of your application and deploy it to the edge in sub-seconds<sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup>, allowing you to preview and test your application in a real-world environment before deploying it to production - make "testing in production" a reality. Whenever the version of your application is ready for production, you can promote it to production with a single click.<sup>[3](#footnote-3)</sup>

Whether you're are a small team or a large enterprise, Zephyr Cloud is designed to remove the ambiguity between different cloud providers, helping you build with speed and freedom.

Zephyr Cloud is now in public beta. If you experience any issues, do jump in our [Discord](https://zephyr-cloud.io/discord) and let us know (we hang out here!).

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

We don't assume you know everything about cloud or edge. Whenever we mention a concept or a piece of software, we aim to provide relevant links wherever possible. Our documentation site is Open Sourced, if you wish to contribute, do check out our [Github](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/docs) and open any issues/pull requests.

At the same time, it'd be useful to have a basic understanding of modern frontend frameworks such as [React](https://react.dev), running commands in terminals, [node](https://nodejs.org/en), package management solutions such as [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/install) and the concept (or usage) of [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/). If you're new to web development, we recommend you to check out [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) for a comprehensive guide. On the other hand, if you want to know more about Micro-Frontends and [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io), our [Module Federation Deep Dive](/learning/concepts/module-federation#deep-dive) is prepared for you. 


Last but not least, welcome to dive into the [learning section](/learning) when you are ready to dive into Micro-Frontends, it's terminologies and configuration.
