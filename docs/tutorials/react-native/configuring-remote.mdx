## Setting Up a React Native Remote Application

Starting from our base RSpack setup, we need to make some modifications to support exporting modules as a remote.

First, we need to stabilize the port number because we don't want it colliding with other running servers or services.

### Stabilizing the port number

That starts with setting the PORT number for the React Native application to talk to the bundler.

To do that we add `RCT_METRO_PORT` to the `ios` script in the `package.json` file.

```json
"ios": "RTC_METRO_PORT=8081 react-native run-ios --no-packager",
```

This will compile the iOS application using the port number 8081. You can change this port number to any other number that is not being used by other services.

Next we need to stabilize the port number for the bundler.

To do that we add the `--port` flag to the `react-native start` command in the `package.json` file.

```json
"start": "react-native start --port 8081",
```

Now the application and the bundler will be fixed to the same port number.

### Running The Application

Now that the application is configured we can build and run it.

```bash
npm run ios
```

This will build the application and run it on the iOS simulator.

Next we need to start the bundler:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the bundler and the application will be able to connect to it.

You will want to keep the bundler running while you are developing so that any changes you make to the code are reflected immediately.

### Configuring The Remote For Module Federation

Because we need to share dependencies between the host and the remotes, we need to bring the dependencies of the remote application into the RSpack confiugration file.

To do this we add this line:

```ts
import pkg from './package.json' with { type: "json" };
```

To the top of the `rspack.config.mjs` file.

Then we need to add the Module Federation Plugin to the plugins array.

```ts
  new Repack.plugins.ModuleFederationPluginV2({
    name: '[app-name]',
    filename: '[app-name].container.js.bundle',
    exposes: {
    },
    shared: Object.fromEntries(
      Object.entries(pkg.dependencies).map((dep, version) => {
        return [
          dep,
          {singleton: true, eager: true, requiredVersion: version},
        ];
      }),
    ),
  }),
```

You'll need to replace `[app-name]` with the name of the application. You should also replace the `[app-name]` callout on the `filename` key with your application name.

The code for the shared object will iterate through all of the dependencies in the `package.json` file and create a new object that has the version number as `requiredVersion` and `singleton` and `eager` set to `true`.

`singleton` means that the dependency will be loaded only once and shared across the remotes.

`eager` means that the dependency will be loaded when the host is loaded.

`requiredVersion` is the version of the dependency that is required by this remote.

### Exposing Modules

Next well need to add all of the modules that we want to expose to host applications to the `exposes` object.

Here is an example of how to expose a component named `CartList`:

```ts
exposes: {
  CartList: './src/components/CartList',
},
```

This will expose the `CartList` component to any host application.

### Any Module Can Be Exposed

Any module can be exposed. This includes components, hooks, utilities, and more.

### Module Federation Enhanced

The Module Federation Enhanced library is required for the runtime to work properly.

To install it we run:

```bash
npm install @module-federation/enhanced
```

### Checking Your Work

Once you have Module Federation configured you can make sure it is working by running `npm start` and then using curl to check for the container file.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/ios/Cart.container.js.bundle
```

If you see a large block of JavaScript, then you know that the remote is configured correctly.

### Using the Federated Module

Now that we have the remote application configured, we can use the federated module in a host application. For more information on how to use the federated module, please refer to the [Setting Up a React Native Host Application](./configuring host.md) documentation.

### Applications Can Be Both Hosts and Remotes

Applications can be both hosts and remotes. This allows you to create a truly federated architecture.

To do this the application simply needs to also have a `remotes` object in the `ModuleFederationPluginV2` configuration. And then it can import modules from other remotes.
