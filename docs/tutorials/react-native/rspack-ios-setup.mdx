## Setting Up a React Native iOS Application with RSpack

First we need to create an application using the React Native CLI.

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli init myapp
```

This will create a new application using the default template.

You will be prompted to install CocoaPods dependencies. You should do that.

### Converting Metro to Rspack

Metro doesn't support Module Federation. It's also slow. Rspack is a faster bundler that supports Module Federation.

To convert the project to use Rspack, we can use the @callstack/repack-init package.

```bash
npx @callstack/repack-init
```

You can decide between using Rspack or Webpack. We recommend using Rspack for better performance.

### Converting to pnpm

We recommend using pnpm for your package manager. To convert simply remove the existing `package-lock.json` file and run `pnpm i`.

### Updating The Bundle

The repack init will add some bundles to the project. You need to run `bundle install` to install the additional dependencies.

```bash
bundle install
```

### Modifying The package.json Scripts

There is an additional change that we recommend making to the `package.json` scripts. We recommend splitting up the building of the application from the bundling of the application.

To do this we add the `--no-packager` flag to the `react-native run-ios` command. Like so:

```json
"scripts": {
  "ios": "react-native run-ios --no-packager"
}
```

This will compile the iOS application but not bundle the JavaScript code.

You can start the bundler separately using `pnpm start`.
