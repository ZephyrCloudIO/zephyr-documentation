# Micro-Frontends with Zephyr - The Complete Guide

Micro-Frontends' configuration and deployment processes are known to be complicated and painful to debug. Zephyr Cloud not only to helps with resolving dynamic URL and development process for applications applying Micro-Frontends architecture, but also deployment, versioning and more. This section will walk through the necessary configuration to ensure you have a smooth development workflow and deployment process.

## Checklist

<Steps>
### Micro-Frontends Configuration

We have first class support for a Micro-Frontends architecture based on [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io). Other Micro-Frontends architectures may already work or will be supported in the future.

An example working shell app's configuration can be seen below as well as [in our example repository](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples/blob/comprehensive-react-18/examples/comprehensive-react-18/app-01/rspack.config.js). For detailed bundler-specific configurations, see our [bundler guides](/bundlers/rspack).

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
new ModuleFederationPluginV1({
      name: 'app_01',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      remotes: {
        app_02: 'app_02@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
        app_03: 'app_03@http://localhost:3003/remoteEntry.js',
        app_04: 'app_04@http://localhost:3004/remoteEntry.js',
        app_05: 'app_05@http://localhost:3005/remoteEntry.js',
      },
      exposes: {
        './SideNav': './src/SideNav',
        './Page': './src/Page',
      },
      shared: {
        ...deps,
        '@material-ui/core': {
          singleton: true,
        },
        'react-router-dom': {
          singleton: true,
        },
        'react-dom': {
          singleton: true,
        },
        react: {
          singleton: true,
        },
      },
    }),
```

### Build remotes first

At the moment. when we are resolving your remote dependencies, we will need the remote applications to be built first. Be wary that the first built remotes should not be consuming any other remotes.

In the example below where you have one shell and one remote, you will need to build the remote first.

![mf_1_circular_dependencies](/mf_guide_1_circular_dependency.webp)

Let's take a look at another example. You have a shell application, within the shell app you have two modules: **HeaderNav** and **TaskContent**.

![mf_2_circular_dependencies](/mf_guide_2_circular_dependency.webp)

The **HeaderNav** exposes **Logo**, **UserProfileInfo** and **LeftNav**.

The **TaskContent** exposes **SearchBar**.

In this scenario, **LeftNav** is consumed by **TaskContent**; **SearchBar** is consumed by **HeaderNav**.

You will need to build either the **TaskContent** or the **HeaderNav** first, comment out the remotes that have yet built and add them back later.

### `package.json` name and Module Federation config

Make sure your remotes' package.json `name` field is exactly the same as your [Module Federation Configurations](https://module-federation.io/configure/index.html) like so:

```json title="package.json from your first remote app"
name: 'post'
```

```json title="package.json from your second remote app"
// Your first remote's package.json
name: 'follow'
```

```ts title="Module Federation config in your host"
`remotes: ['post', follow']`;
```

example](/tutorials/create-mf-app#zephyr-dependencies-in-packagejson-optional)

### Git repository

Several details related to git are required to have a successful deployment.

- Project directory must be a git repository
- Current project directory must have a branch
- Current project must have created a commit

### Confirm access right

Do you have the admin or editor access to the application you are trying to deploy? You can check it on [Zephyr Dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io).

If you don't have it yet, you can contact your Admin on Zephyr dashboard to invite you and set up the correct access right. Learn more about [Teams & Members](/features/teams-members).
