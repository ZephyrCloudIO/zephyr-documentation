# Building with GitLab Runner
Zephyr requires an authenticated user in order to publish updates. In order to configure your GitLab Runner pipeline to build and deploy with Zephyr, you will need to add a token to the CI/CD variables.

## Adding the GitLab CI/CD Variable
You will need to create a full access token on your [API token](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io/profile/settings/user-tokens) page. After creating this token, you will need to add it as a CI/CD variable in your GitLab project.

### Steps to add the token:
1. Navigate to your GitLab project
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **CI/CD**
3. Expand the **Variables** section
4. Click **Add variable**
5. Set the following values:
   - **Key**: `ZE_SECRET_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Your Zephyr API token
   - **Type**: Variable
   - **Environment scope**: All (or specify specific environments)
   - **Protect variable**: Check if you want to use it only in protected branches
   - **Mask variable**: Check to hide the value in job logs

## Using the token in GitLab CI/CD

In your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, the token will be automatically available as an environment variable:

```yml title=.gitlab-ci.yml
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  variables:
    ZE_SECRET_TOKEN: $ZE_SECRET_TOKEN
```

For more explicit control, you can also reference it directly:

```yml title=.gitlab-ci.yml
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  environment:
    name: production
  variables:
    ZE_SECRET_TOKEN: $ZE_SECRET_TOKEN
```

## Plugin behavior when secret token presents
When the Zephyr plugin is triggered on an environment that holds the `ZE_SECRET_TOKEN` environment variable, it will use this token to authenticate with the Zephyr API and bypass the usual log in step. 

You will notice that with a log in the console, the plugin will print the following message:

```shell
 ZEPHYR   Token found in environment. Using secret token for authentication
```

## Example GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

Here's a complete example of a GitLab CI/CD pipeline using Zephyr:

```yml title=.gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - install
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  npm_config_cache: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.npm"

cache:
  key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
  paths:
    - .npm/
    - node_modules/

install:
  stage: install
  script:
    - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - node_modules/
    expire_in: 1 hour

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 day
  variables:
    ZE_SECRET_TOKEN: $ZE_SECRET_TOKEN

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run deploy
  only:
    - main
  environment:
    name: production
  variables:
    ZE_SECRET_TOKEN: $ZE_SECRET_TOKEN
```

## Troubleshooting

### Token not found
If you see an error about authentication failing, ensure:
- The variable name is exactly `ZE_SECRET_TOKEN`
- The variable is available in the environment where your job is running
- The token has not expired

### Protected variables
If using protected variables, ensure your pipeline is running on a protected branch or tag.

### Masked variables
When a variable is masked, it won't appear in job logs. This is recommended for security but can make debugging harder. Temporarily unmask if you need to troubleshoot.
