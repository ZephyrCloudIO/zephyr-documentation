## Micro-Frontends & Remotes

In Zephyr Mission Control, you have the ability to manage your micro-frontends and their respective remote versions. Each registered remote applications are  listed under **Remotes**. You can preview the specific versions that are currently deployed or previously deployed.



### Switching Applications

### Switching Remotes

You can switch between different versions of your remotes to preview under the **Version** field. 

Additionally, when you are previewing a host application which consumes other remotes, you can also switch the remote's version under the list of **Remotes** to inspect how different versions of remotes intercepts with host application. 

## Tags 

Tags are either auto-generated by us, or set up in Zephyr's dashboard by you. When you are deploying an application through Zephyr (for the first time), We will generate a tag fits your current condition. 

You can configure specific **Tag rules** in your application's **Settings** page under **Tags** on Zephyr dashboard by creating, or editing a tag. Tags that are attached to an application is shown under **Tags** field on browser extension.
