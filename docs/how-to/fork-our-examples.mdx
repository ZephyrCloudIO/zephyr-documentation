# Fork Our Examples

## Use a Single Example

The quickest way to get started with a single example is to use degit. Degit lets you copy any single example from our examples directory with the following command

```bash title=Terminal

npx degit ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples/examples/create-default-webpack-mf local-copy
```
Replace `create-default-webpack-mf` with whatever example name you want to copy. Replace `local-copy` with whatever you'd like to call it, but this gets a copy of just that example. Once you have the example you wish to use, initialize git in whichever way you normally do and commit changes. Each of our examples has a `README` you can follow to deploy with zephyr.

## Fork'em all

If you would like to fork the entire repo and explore all the sample projects [click here](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-examples/fork) and follow the `README` in the respective example directory.
