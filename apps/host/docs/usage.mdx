# Features

The core of Zephyr is developed to plug into your applications' build process and to create a seamless deployment workflow, thus you can use our core features by only downloading our npm packages (you will still need to register an account via our [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) or [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn)).

For specific packages and what to download, please refer to our [frameworks and bundlers guide](/supported) or [recipes for different frameworks](/recipes) for a detailed walk through.

Whilest using our [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) and [dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io) is not strictly necessary, it provides useful functionality such as [preview versions](#preview-versions), [dependency management](#dependency-management) and more - we highly recommend you to download or use them to fully utilise Zephyr.

In this section, we will explain features offered by Zephyr and how you can use them.
