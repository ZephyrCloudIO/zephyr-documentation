# Build Applications

Build and deploy micro-frontend applications with Zephyr Cloud's powerful platform. This content will be federated from the web MFE when remotes are running.

## What is Zephyr Build?

Zephyr Build provides everything you need to create scalable micro-frontend applications using Module Federation. Our platform supports all major JavaScript frameworks and bundlers, making it easy to integrate with your existing development workflow.

## Key Features

- **Universal Framework Support** - Works with React, Vue, Angular, and more
- **Multi-Bundler Integration** - Supports Webpack, Vite, Rspack, Parcel, and others
- **Module Federation** - Share code and dependencies across applications
- **Automatic Optimization** - Smart bundling and dependency resolution
- **Development Tools** - Browser extension and CLI for streamlined workflows

## Getting Started

Choose your path based on your project setup:

### New Projects
- [Create Your First App](/general/create-mf-app) - Start from scratch with a new micro-frontend application
- [Framework Recipes](/recipes) - Follow step-by-step guides for your preferred framework

### Existing Projects
- Existing App Integration - Add Zephyr to your current application
- [Migration Guides](/how-to/migrate-nx-webpack-to-rspack) - Move from other tools to Zephyr
