This error occurs when attempting to access a URL that doesn't exist. It may be due to a mistyped URL, a changed URL, or the project being deleted or moved.

It was either by a mistyped `project_uid` _(subdomain)_ or the URL path doesn't exist:

`https://<project_uid>.valorkin.dev/<path>`

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Make sure you are using the latest deployment URL for your tag.

Re-run your build and ensure you clicked on the latest deployment URL for your tag and not an older one that was in your copy-paste history.

```bash
npm run build
