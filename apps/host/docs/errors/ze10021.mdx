This error happens when your terminal session doesn't have the necessary permissions to create the `dist` folder. This can happen if you're running the command as a different user or if the permissions on the folder are incorrect.

This issue typically occurs due to insufficient permissions. Possible causes include:

- **Incorrect User:** The command might be run by a user without the necessary permissions.
- **Permission Settings:** The permissions for the parent directory or the `dist` folder may be incorrectly set.

To resolve this, ensure you have the appropriate permissions for the directory where you're trying to create the `dist` folder, or try running the command with elevated privileges.

## Debugging the error

<Steps>

### Check Permissions

Ensure that the user running the command has the necessary permissions to create the `dist` folder. You can check the permissions by running the following command:

```bash
ls -l /path/to/parent/directory
```

If the permissions are incorrect, you can change them using the `chmod` command. For example, to give full permissions to the owner, you can run:

```bash
chmod 700 /path/to/parent/directory
```
