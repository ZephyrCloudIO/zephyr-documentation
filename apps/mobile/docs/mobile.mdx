# Mobile Development with Zephyr

Build cross-platform mobile applications using React Native and Module Federation.

## What is Zephyr Mobile?

Zephyr Mobile extends our micro-frontend platform to React Native, enabling you to share code, components, and business logic between web and mobile applications. Build once, deploy everywhere.

## React Native Integration

Our React Native integration works seamlessly with Re.Pack, providing Module Federation capabilities for mobile applications.

## Key Features

- **Code Sharing** - Share components between web and mobile
- **Module Federation** - Dynamic loading of remote modules
- **Hot Reload** - Fast development with live updates  
- **Cross-Platform** - Deploy to iOS and Android
- **Bundle Splitting** - Optimize app size and loading

## Architecture Benefits

### Micro-Frontend Architecture for Mobile
- **Independent Teams** - Different teams can work on different parts of the app
- **Incremental Updates** - Update parts of your app without full redeployment
- **Technology Diversity** - Mix different React Native libraries and approaches
- **Scalability** - Easily add new features and modules

### Shared Business Logic
- **Consistent Experience** - Same logic across web and mobile
- **Reduced Maintenance** - Single source of truth for business rules
- **Faster Development** - Reuse existing web components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- React Native development environment
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

### Quick Setup

1. **Install Zephyr CLI**
```bash
npm install -g zephyr-cli
```

2. **Create a new React Native project**
```bash
npx react-native init MyMobileApp
cd MyMobileApp
```

3. **Add Zephyr integration**
```bash
zephyr init --mobile
```

4. **Configure Re.Pack**
Follow our [Re.Pack Module Federation guide](/recipes/repack-mf) for detailed setup instructions.

## Common Use Cases

### Multi-Team Development
- **Feature Teams** - Each team owns a specific feature module
- **Platform Teams** - Shared infrastructure and common components
- **Independent Deployment** - Teams can deploy updates independently

### Progressive Migration
- **Gradual Adoption** - Migrate existing apps piece by piece
- **Risk Mitigation** - Test new features with limited user groups
- **Legacy Integration** - Keep existing code while adding new modules

### Cross-Platform Consistency
- **Shared Components** - Use the same UI components on web and mobile
- **Business Logic** - Share complex business rules and validations
- **Data Layer** - Consistent API integration and state management

## Best Practices

### Performance
- **Bundle Optimization** - Only load what you need
- **Caching Strategy** - Cache modules for faster subsequent loads
- **Network Awareness** - Handle offline scenarios gracefully

### Development
- **Module Boundaries** - Clear interfaces between modules
- **Testing Strategy** - Test modules independently
- **Version Management** - Coordinate module versions across teams
