## State Manager Sharing Between React Native Applications

Sharing state management logic between React Native applications is a common requirement. This can be achieved by sharing the store implementation between the applications.

### Example

Let's say we have two applications, `app1` and `app2`, and we want to share the state management logic between them.

Show below is the store implementation that is exposed as a remote module from `app1`.

```ts
// app1/store.ts
import { createStore, useStore } from "zustand";

export const store = createStore<{
  count: number;
  increment: () => void;
  decrement: () => void;
}>((set) => ({
  count: 100,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
}));

export const useCounter = () => {
  return useStore(store);
};
```

And the `rspack.config.mjs` file in `app1` is configured to expose the store as a remote module.

```ts
    new Repack.plugins.ModuleFederationPluginV2({
      ...
      exposes: {
        './store': './store',
      },
      shared: Object.fromEntries(
        Object.entries(pkg.dependencies).map(([dep, {version}]) => {
          return [
            dep,
            {singleton: true, eager: true, requiredVersion: version},
          ];
        }),
      ),
    })
```

### Using The Store In App2

Now, let's say we have an application called `app2` that wants to use the store from `app1`. The easiest way to do this is to first bootstrap `app2` using the boostrapping formula from the [bootstrapping your application](./bootstrapping your application.md) guide. This will allow a synchronous import of the store.

```ts
import { useCounter } from "app1/store";

const Counter = () => {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button onPress={increment} title="Increment" />
      <Button onPress={decrement} title="Decrement" />
    </View>
  );
};
```

The module federation configuration of `app2` needs to be configured to add `app1` as an avaible remote:

```ts
    new Repack.plugins.ModuleFederationPluginV2({
      remotes: {
        app1: `app1@http://localhost:8081/ios/Remote1.container.js.bundle`,
      },
      shared: Object.fromEntries(
        Object.entries(pkg.dependencies).map(([dep, {version}]) => {
          return [
            dep,
            {singleton: true, eager: true, requiredVersion: version},
          ];
        }),
      ),
    }),
```

Because the dependencies are shared, the store will be available in `app2` without any additional configuration, or the import of the `zustand` library used to managed the state.

### State Management Compatability

All of the popular state management libraries are supported with Module Federation.
