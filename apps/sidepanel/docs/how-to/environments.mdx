# Environments

:::warning Requirements

Custom domains _(cnames)_ are only available for applications deployed through a Custom Deployment Integration Provider.

:::

Environments support custom DNS records, allowing each deployment to have unique domain configurations tailored to its requirements.

## When a Tag is Not Enough

Tags are used to identify specific versions based on predefined conditions, facilitating easy management of builds. Environments can be configured to use either a specific version or a tag, offering flexibility in versioning.

[Learn more about tags, versions, and tag rules](../how-to/versioning-tags.mdx#tag-rules-on-dashboard).

## General Configuration

When assigning a custom domain name, creating a new tag and additional verification steps in environment settings can be helpful. Here’s how to set up a custom domain before editing DNS records.

### 1. Create a New Tag (Optional)

Since a custom domain can be tied to either a **Version** or a **Tag**, creating a specific tag can help clearly identify the application version or deployment rules.

a. Select an application on the [Zephyr Dashboard](https://app.zephyr-cloud.io), go to **Settings**, and select **Tags** on the left navigation bar.

b. Click on **Create Tag**, provide a **Tag name**, and select a [**Tag condition**](/how-to/versioning-tags#tag-rules-on-dashboard). - Example: If you set the tag condition to **Branch** and enter your branch name (e.g., `user/feature`), any deployment under this branch will attach to this tag, and its URL will automatically update with each new deployment that satisfies the condition.

c. Run a build command to deploy your application and confirm the latest deployed version is attached to the tag by viewing **Version** next to the tag name on Zephyr’s dashboard, or by using the [Zephyr Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn) to verify deployment.

### 2. Environment Settings

1. Select an application, navigate to **Settings**, and click **Environment** on the left.

2. On the **Environment** page, click **Create Environment**.

#### Environment Input Fields

<div className="pl-4">
<dl>
<dt>`Environment name`</dt>
<dd>This is the display name for the environment on the dashboard. While it doesn’t affect DNS settings, it’s useful to choose a name that reflects the domain or tag conditions related to this environment.</dd>

<dt>`Environment Conditions - Channel`</dt>
<dd>
  Select either **Tag** or **Version**. After selection, a version URL will
  appear in the **Version** field on the right.
</dd>

<dt>`Custom DNS name`</dt>
<dd>
  Enter the full URL for the custom domain. If you have configured a Cloud
  Provider, you can input custom domains like `sub.domain.com` without needing
  `https://`.
</dd>

<dt>`Description`</dt>
<dd>A brief description can be helpful for managing multiple environments.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

3. Copy the domain name

After selecting a **Channel**, copy the version URL that appears in the **Version** field. Keep this handy for the next step, as it may need adjustments depending on your registrar’s DNS settings.

You can confirm the deployed URL is attached to the newly created tag by checking the **Environment** settings and the version URL. Here are the next steps you can choose:

## Cloudflare

Our Cloudflare integration does not needs any extra steps to configure a custom domain, just by creating an environment in our dashboard, we automatically creates all DNS records and routes for you.

After adding a new domain, you can see in your worker's configuration a custom entry for it was added:

![route](/cf-domains.png)

And that a custom DNS entry was automatically added to your domain:

![dns](/cf-dns-entry.png)

## Netlify

:::info Prerequisites

Attach a domain to a Netlify site project and set the Netlify integration as the **Default deployment integration** on Zephyr’s dashboard. You can confirm domain management status under your Netlify Team account’s **Domain** settings.

If needed, refer to the Netlify Configuration Guide and confirm that you meet all requirements for wildcard subdomains on Netlify.

:::

1. Log into Netlify and go to **Domains**. Select the domain attached to the site project configured as the **Default Deployment Integration** on Zephyr’s dashboard.

2. Trim the version URL by removing `https://` and the trailing slash.

3. Add a new `CNAME` record:
   - For the primary domain (`www`), set **Name** to `www` and **Value** to the edited version URL. Delete the root domain under the **NETLIFY** type.
   - For a subdomain, enter **Name** (e.g., `sub`) and **Value** as the edited version URL.

4. Return to Zephyr’s **Environment** page and add the entry as `www.domain.com` (for the primary domain) or `sub.domain.com` (for the subdomain).

5. Save the configuration to complete your custom domain setup.

## Promote a Previous Version to Custom Domain

Once your custom domain is set up, you can promote a previous deployment to the domain:

1. Go to the application’s **Versions** page.

2. Under **Version history**, select a version to promote and click **Deploy**.

3. Choose the **Environment** for the deployment in the pop-up window, or select a tag to deploy a previous version.

4. Enter **Deploy** in the confirmation field, then click **Yes, I am sure** to finalize.

5. The custom domain should show the content of your version URL shortly. If not, allow a few minutes for DNS propagation.
